It is now called

FeaturelessCube
This is a magical burin, used for inscribing objects with words or runes of magical import. Such a burin also gives you the ability to write spell scrolls.
Writing on a cube is such a fiddly process that you need to be holding it in your hand first.
You would need some powerful implement for that.
If a burin could write in a spell book, you wouldn't need the gnusto spell!
You cannot write just anything on the magic parchment of a scroll: you can only ~copy~ a spell to it.

copy a scroll into your spell book
Unlike scrolls, spell books are magically guarded against the 'theft' of their lore.
Your spell fizzles vaguely out.
A gnusto spell would require close scrutiny of the scroll it is to copy: which you do not seem to be holding.
Your spell fails, as you have no spell book.
Your spell fails, as

Your spell book begins to glow softly.  Slowly, ornately, the words of

Question
Helistar is your colleague, an Enchanter like you who has been much on your mind lately.  She has been investigating some very dark magic indeed, and seems not to be around any more.  You feel rather vague about the details.
(34)
A burin is an engraving and writing tool.
(35)
Something you had a lot to do with, but what exactly?  No, it's gone.
(36)
A one-eyed giant, usually hostile.  (Don't they teach anything at adventurer school these days?)
(37)
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.
(38)
According to Chambers English Dictionary, a grimoire is ~a magician's book for calling up spirits~.
(39)
Your memory is still dream-hazed, but it's coming back. As a trained Enchanter, you have the ability to cast spells like ~frotz~, provided you have learned them in advance.  Some of these spells can be cast at something; others can be cast alone. ^^Spells are very complicated.  Each time you cast one, you forget it (though you can get around this by learning it several times, so as to have several uses up your sleeve).  The only way to hang on to a spell is to have it written down, on a scroll or in a spell book. Scrolls are not ideal for this, and you can only learn a spell from your spell book.  (But you can add spells to your book.) ^^[Type ~learn frotz~ and then ~frotz coin~ for an example.  You can also type ~spells~ to see what you currently have memorised.]

Place
Until quite recently, someone lived here, you feel sure. Now the furniture is matchwood and the windows are glassless.  Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.
There's only the one room: better go ~out~.
Ramshackle Hut
Searching through the furniture, which is good for nothing but firewood now, you come across an old cedarwood box, which you pick up for a closer look.
wooden furniture
The box bears the calligraphed initial H.

This must be the grimoire of dangerous spells kept by your irresponsible friend Helistar.  Many pages are missing, but a few spells remain:^
Helistar's grimoire
The grasslands sway over low hills in all directions: it is a peaceful wilderness, broken only by this hut and a faint path to the north.
You wander around for a while but end up back at the hut.
Grasslands, near Hut
A pleasant pocket valley in the grassy hills, through which a trail runs north-to-south.
The trail runs out to nothing, and you retreat for fear of getting so lost you couldn't find the hut again by nightfall.
You wander around the pleasant valley, but are afraid to lose sight of the trail.

winged horse
chestnut horse
There is 
 here, munching on a pile of oats.
A pair of handsome brown wings suddenly appears on the horse's powerful shoulders.  The horse turns in a complete circle, a look of puzzlement on his face.
He is mainly thinking about oats.  Partly who you are and what you're up to, but mainly oats.
You ride around for a while, exercising the horse, but soon enough he tires of this and pointedly brings you back to the oats.  Obligingly you dismount and he begins grazing again.
You begin to ride north.  Then, slowly at first but with increasing sureness, the horse begins beating its powerful wings.  You rise majestically through the air, sailing gracefully across a chasm where the hills fall away. The horse lands gently on the far side and deposits you, taking to the skies again.^
horse
Sifting through the oats, you find a shiny scroll!  Lucky you got to it before the horse did.  As you turn it over in your hands, it seems undamaged.
What would you want with all those oats?

(bozbar_spell)
The road ends suddenly at a wide chasm.  The road leads upward to the north, and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.
The chasm is too perilous to approach.  The only safe way is up and to the north.
You jump bravely into the chasm, and plunge... gracefully through the air.  (It gets a bit less noble and airy after that.)
Edge of Chasm
Lying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.
It has some V-markings, some scaly parts, colours from grey to reddish-brown. Is that any help?
The snake hisses angrily!
Beside a clump of daffodils is a featureless white cube.
The snake is replaced by a clump of daffodils.
A featureless cube rests where the snake took off from.
The snake is transformed into a huge, winged serpent, a dragon which bellows and leaps out into the chasm, backwinging furiously... and knocking you over the edge quite by accident.
Horrid reptilian thoughts insinuate their way into you.
The slipperiness of its skin is only one of many reasons why this is ill-advised.
hissing snake
The snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.
The snake won't let you near that cube!

The road crosses the top of a ridge here, sloping downwards to the south and the northwest.  A track diverges to east.
Crest of Hill
A tortoise ambles along the road, extremely slowly.
The tortoise (slowly) turns its neck to look at you (stupidly).
Just how safe do you want your surroundings to be?
The tortoise seems to be incapable of expressing surprise, but is now soaring away high in the sky. Something rather grubby is left behind.
For a moment you think there is nothing there, as you chew absentmindedly on a leaf.  But somewhere inside the tortoise is a sense of wonder at the amazing blue canopy of the sky.
Your parents always warned you not to pick up casual acquaintances met on the road.
^A tortoise-feather flutters to the ground before you!
^High in the sky,
^Far above you,
^Tiny in the blue sky,
 a tortoise flaps across the sun.

(lobal_spell)
It looks as if the tortoise was eating something - once it might have been a scroll, but now it lies there, chewed up like a lettuce leaf.
Before your eyes, the scroll begins to repair itself, failing only at the very last tear.  Not quite perfect perhaps, but certainly a readable, if torn scroll.
~Eating your words~ is notoriously dangerous for a wizard. Rearranged in the stomach, a spell might do anything!
chewed scroll
Possibly your rarest, and also least valuable, possession.
tortoise feather
This is a cave mouth, at one end of a road which winds southeast over rising ground.  The entrance west to the caves is a dark tunnel, and only a footpath runs further north, into gorse.
Cave Mouth
It just looks like an ordinary heavy iron door.
^The iron door stands open.
^The iron door is unlocked but shut.
A heavy iron door bars the cave mouth.
iron door
Clotted in the mud beside the door is a perfect sapphire.
As you gaze into the perfect blue of the sapphire, you feel your mind begin to reel.  Unable to bear the naked sight of perfection, you look away, ashamed. As you do so, the sapphire cracks and wastes away to thin hot dust.  But something remains, something in your mind...
perfect sapphire
cause perfection
Trying to make everything perfect was a little too ambitious.
Oh, don't be too hard on yourself.
Your spell is not powerful enough to restore the lost pages.

(caskly_spell)
A wide but shallow cave not far inside the hill.  There is no obvious exit, except for the way you came in.
Something bars your way, and you hear the scales jangling militantly.  You were trying to steal its coins!
Something bars your way, and you hear the scales jangle slightly with energy.
The only way is back ~out~ through the iron door.

Balanced on a rock formation is a featureless white cube.

^A fair-sized pair of scales hangs from a bracket in the cave wall.  
The scales are balanced.
The left-hand side is higher.
The right-hand side is higher.
There are left and right hand pans, which you should refer to individually.

(urbzig_spell)
A huge buck-toothed cyclops menaces you, armed with a heavy mace!
Does the term ~death wish~ mean anything to you?
The cyclops bellows with glee as your spell has no effect.  (After all, he wouldn't be ~dangerous~ if an urbzig spell worked on him, would he?)
He roars incoherently, swinging the mace!
Feeling that he's given you quite long enough to explain why you made such a mess of his life, he swings the great mace maniacally down on you!
^The cyclops leaps and bellows!
^Whirling the mace, the cyclops jabbers at you incoherently.
^The cyclops is losing patience (the appropriate cyclops word is untranslatable into English, but approximately means ~forbearance in not smashing all nearby skulls~).
^The cyclops jabs you with the mace, almost breaking your rib.

It looks much too heavy for you to even lift.

The footpath from the cave mouth runs into dense, impenetrable gorse bushes.  Perhaps it wasn't so much a footpath as a rill in the earth where roots wouldn't take; anyway, there's no way but back south.
Gorse Bushes
Slung over one of the gorse bushes is a beautiful red carpet.
This is a carpet of unusual design. It is red, beautifully woven and bears a pattern of cubes.
Not until the carpet's on the ground, you can't.
Not until the carpet's on the ground, you can't.
Mysteriously, the carpet rucks and pulls until you're thrown off.  It settles back on the white floor with a contented sigh.
The carpet rises suddenly, crashing into the roof of the cave and throwing you back off again.  Painfully.
The carpet rises suddenly into the fluffy white clouds, and after a headlong journey deposits you...^
Not while you're on it!

This is a crowded, noisy bazaar.  Directly in front of you is a lottery!  But the contemptuous-looking barker is doing a very poor trade: hardly anyone wants his first prize, the big cuddly toy elephant, or even his nineteenth prize, a featureless white cube.
^~Roll up!  Roll up!  One silver piece for three goes!~
^~Come on, then!  Just a silver coin gets you three!~
^~Think what you could win, all for one silver coin!~
^~This could be your lucky day!~
~None of that!~ snaps the barker angrily, putting you off your study habits.  He mutters about ~Enchanter cheats~, but under the circumstances you decide to let the insult pass.
Everywhere, the crowds of jabbering natives block your way to all the good stalls.  In fact, the only one you can get at is this dismal lottery.
Crowded Bazaar
There are a hundred holes each way, making, um, let's see, yes, ten thousand tickets in all. Still, there are nineteen prizes, so your odds must be, oh, well, not too awful anyway.
The barker stabs you in the chest with his finger.  ~That's a silver coin to you, bub!~
That ticket's already taken.
The barker looks metaphysically embarrassed. ~Um, Inform's object creation system seems not to have worked.~
Randomly picking from the 
 numbered holes with tickets in, you

~No changes of mind, that's your ticket now!  Give it to me if you want to play it.~
The barker is burly, and won't let you tamper with the board.
Behind the barker is a huge drilled board, and inside each little numbered hole is a rolled-up lottery ticket.

A boxer gone to seed who failed as a magician all down the coast, that'd be your guess.
No way.  He must weigh twice what you do.
~Just one silver coin and a prize could be yours!~
He blows the dust off it.  ~Genuine antique, that.~
~Good quality merchandise,~ he says, in a way that suggests he can only spell one of those three words.
~Three tickets for one silver coin!~
~Just play the game, bub.~
The barker glowers at you.
This is a crowded, noisy bazaar.  Directly in front of you is the lottery!
With very bad grace, the barker shoves the cuddly toy elephant into your arms.
This is a crowded, noisy bazaar.  Directly in front of you is the lottery!
With concealed relief, the barker shoves the featureless white cube into your hands.
~Bad luck!  You lose!~
~You've had enough goes already!~ he growls.  No wonder trade is bad.
~What do you call that? One silver coin to play!~
~Bronze!  Not a chance, sunshine.~
Gleefully the barker snatches the gold coin. ~Sorry bub, no change. Business is slack today!~
Grudgingly the barker takes the silver coin and stands back to let you at the board, arms folded.
He's not that much of an animal.
His problem is listening, not hearing.
For a moment his hair seems to comb itself. Irritated, he ruffles it again, and the spell dies an ignominious death.
The barker's mind is a heap of grumbles about lost prizes and scrawny Enchanters.
~Hope that scrawny Enchanter doesn't pick 2306!~ thinks the barker (slowly).
~If that mark does win, hope it's only worthless old 5802,~ ponders the barker.

You really can't fault Helistar on this one.  Death is absolutely immediate, like a sudden blackout curtain...

^^Your foresight in preparing a resurrection was wasted.  The tangled magic of the Balance Room coiled around your puny enchantment like a constricting serpent.
^^With great foresight you prepared yourself for resurrection... Your mind feels a little weaker, but at least you're alive.^
This is a room of bones.  Shoulder blades make up the floor, skulls the walls and leg-bones the door frames. The west exit leads into darkness, but the doorway to the north opens onto a seemingly normal scene.
Some magical force blocks your way, as though that doorway led into adventures from your past which you cannot rejoin now.
You can make out nothing to the west.

This is the end of a long track winding through desolate hills, which runs back west up to the ridge.
The chanting is too quiet to make out.
The endlessly repeating threnody of the monks tells of the legend of one who will some day enlighten their order, and so be taken up to a higher plane.  He (or she, presumably) is known as The Four-Cubed One.
Track, outside Temple
The Temple is featureless and unbroken.  Perhaps the top is open, because the sound must come from somewhere... but you wouldn't bet on it.
The huge temple remains impassive at your relatively puny enchantment.
The temple shakes, but then is still again.
The temple shakes!  White light plays over your hands and possessions, but then all is still again.
The temple shakes and white light bathes you. Smoothly it unfolds itself in a four-dimensional way your senses can barely comprehend.  All you know is that when it is over, you find yourself in...^
^You stand outside an enormous temple in the shape of a perfect, featureless white cube, four hundred feet on a side.  From somewhere within you hear the 
bellowing noise

 of the monks chanting.
It's much like every other gigantic temple in the shape of a featureless white cube you've ever seen.  No obvious way in.

This seems to be the inside of a featureless white cube, forty feet on a side.  The air is stale and there is no exit.

Far below the scales, in the centre of the ~floor~, is a predictably-shaped podium, but it is so dusty and cobwebbed that you can't see what it once was.
Nice try, but it is protected from enchantment.
However dusty it is, the podium is still protected from casual enchantment.
No substitute for old-fashioned hard work, sometimes, and after much patient (sneezy) scrubbing, the podium appears in its true white glory.  Set into it are four sockets, arranged in a two by two square.

The socket rejects that.
There is already a cube in that socket.
With much struggle, you manage to pull the cube away.
As you place the final cube into the sockets, you feel imbued with celestial wisdom (more so than usually). You find yourself growing to the height of the cube, so that you pull the balances back level by hand, and then you grow still further, out of the temple until it is but a cube in your hand, and you are a giant towering over the land. ^^Then, of course, you wake up, glumly realising it's time to go to your job at the new Borphee Laboratories and all those Wheatstone bridge experiments.  But at least you can dream about the old days.
The sockets are all full now, but that doesn't mean anything's happened.
The cube is a predictably perfect fit in the socket.
