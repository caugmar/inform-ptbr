And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from

  -- Mark 15:38
Hush, beating heart of Christabel!
 
  -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ~Christabel~
They crossed the moat and Christabel
Took the key that fitted well;
A little door she opened straight,
All in the middle of the gate
 
  -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ~Christabel~
Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare,
And jealous of the listening air
They steal their way from stair to stair
 
  -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ~Christabel~
A sight to dream of, not to tell!
O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!
 
  -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ~Christabel~
All alchemical books abound with obscure enigmas
or sophisticated operations.
 
  -- ~The Shut Palace Opened~
The first key is that which opens the dark
prisons, in which the sulphur is shut up.
 
  -- ~Six Principal Keys of the Secret Philosophy~
The second key dissolves the compound, or the
stone, and begins the separation of the elements
in a philosophical manner.
 
  -- ~Six Principal Keys of the Secret Philosophy~
The third key comprehends of itself alone a longer
train of operations, than all the rest together.
 
  -- ~Six Principal Keys of the Secret Philosophy~
The fourth key of the art, is the entrance of the
second work; it is that which reduces our water
into earth.
 
  -- ~Six Principal Keys of the Secret Philosophy~
The fifth key of our work is the fermentation of
the stone with the perfect body, to make thereof
the medicine of the third order.
 
  -- ~Six Principal Keys of the Secret Philosophy~
The sixth key teaches the multiplication of the
stone, by the reiteration of the same operation,
which consists but in opening and shutting,
imbibing and drying; whereby the virtues of the
stone are infinitely multiplied.
 
  -- ~Six Principal Keys of the Secret Philosophy~
Now they are giving me a fashionable white straw hat
And a black veil that molds to my face,
  they are making me one of them.
They are leading me to the shorn grove,
  the circle of hives.
 
  -- Sylvia Plath, ~The Bee Meeting~
dixitque Deus fiat lux et facta est lux
et vidit Deus lucem quod essem bona
et divisit lucem ac tenebras.
 
  -- liber Genesis 1:3-4
If this furious serpent, after it has been
dissolved by the universal menstruum, does not
turn into our virgin milk, invisibly devouring
away every thing that comes near it, it is
plainly to be seen that you err in the notion of
the universal menstruum.
 
  -- Urbigens, ~100 Aphorisms~
Take of aqua vitae, and put into this vegetable
humidity a third part of a honey-comb, ferment or
digest it in a gentle heat, and repeat the
distillation nine times, renewing the comb every
second distillation.
 
  -- Raymond Lully, ~The Hermetic Mercuries~
I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have
eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my
wine with my milk.
 
  -- Song of Songs 5:1
Now this our second and living water is called
azoth: it is also called the soul of the
dissolved bodies, which souls we have even now
tied together for the use of the wise philosopher.
 
  -- ~The Secret Book of Artephius~
The position [of Master] still had glamour,
repute, a good deal of personal power. It carried
a certain amount of patronage. But its duties had
faded away. Anyone who filled it had to create
for himself the work to do.
 
  -- C P Snow, ~The Masters~
Few human institutions had a history so
continuous, so personal, so day-to-day.
 
  -- C P Snow, ~The Masters~
The job of the writer is to describe the rose;
that of the poet to sing its virtues; that of the
artist to convey its beauty; that of the lawyer
to convince us that it's not a rose at all.

all the puzzles
How do I enter the college?
The cobbles in Chapel Street are in poor repair. Perhaps you should examine them more closely?
The window in Biblioll Street is a tempting target. Have you tried to throw the cobble at it?
The busker asks for an object from the audience. Perhaps you should oblige him.
Have you tried giving your handbag to the busker?
Have you examined the police constable carefully while he's standing in Bridge Street? Is there anything different about him in that location?
Have you tried giving something to the police constable?
The police constable seems to want to take part in the magic trick, but he needs a bit of encouragement. Have you tried instructing him in what to do?
Have you tried breaking the window in Biblioll Street while the police constable is distracted?
Have you tried tickling the sleeping don with the feather?
You need to find a place to hide the key where no-one would think of looking. What about getting the busker to use it as part of his trick?
entering the college
How do I enter Malcolm's room?
Most colleges in Christminster have a gate list; try finding your brother's room on that.
Have you tried visiting Malcolm's room yet?
Have you examined the porter closely?
Have you spoken to the porter yet?
The porter is deaf. Is there any way you might signal that you want one of his keys?
The porter doesn't want to give you a key until he know who you are. Is there any way you could convince him of your identity (remember that he's deaf, so you can't speak to him)?
entering Malcolm's room
Help! I'm stuck! What do I do now?
Try to enter the college.
Try visiting Malcolm.
Malcolm's room has clearly been ransacked for something important. Perhaps you can succeed where the burglars failed.
Try getting into the library and reading some of the books there.
Try visiting the Master in his lodgings.
When you've decoded the lab book, you'll realise that you need to look things up. Try borrowing the relevant texts.
Try asking the Master about the things you now know about.
Pay a visit to Wilderspin.
Try investigating Wilderspin's fireplace more closely.
Try to escape from the secret passage. You'll need Wilderspin's help, of course.
Pay a visit to the cellars and see what you can find there.
Have you met Edward Forbes yet?
Can you persuade Edward to go to his supervision with Bungay?
Try getting into the college gardens?
The gardeners must have a key to the garden gate. Perhaps you can find where they have left it.
Try crossing the river on the punt.
You may need to convince Edward to help you cross the river, since he can punt and you can't.
Now you should be close to reuniting Edward and his parrot.
Have you visited Edward in his room?
You should now be at a point where you can put to use all the knowledge you've gathered and all the things you've found.
Are you sure you can't get back into the Master's Lodgings?
Is there any way you can eavesdrop on Jarboe and Bungay's telephone conversation?
Try to persuade the Master to invite you to tonight's commemoration dinner.
Attend tonight's commemoration dinner.
Eat up your food!
Don't keep good things to yourself.
Now's the time to put the knowledge you gained from the telephone conversation to use.
Try to get through the crumbling door.
Now all you have to do is save Malcolm and escape.
what now?
I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that. Type ~help~ on its own for a menu of subjects I can help you with.

^If you've written an adventure game which is shareware or commercial, and if you enjoyed ~Christminster~ sufficiently that you think you would have paid for it if it weren't free of charge, then why not express your appreciation by sending me a registered copy of your own game?^
There is an archive of interactive fiction and adventure games at the German National Research Centre for Computer Science, maintained by Volker Blasius. You can get files from the archive using anonymous FTP from the address ~ftp.gmd.de~, in the directory ~/if-archive~.^
^The archive contains many free and shareware adventure games, a number of adventure game compilers, and lots of miscellaneous material relating to the genre.^
^~Christminster~ was compiled using ~Inform~, Graham Nelson's compiler for adventure games. ~Inform~ takes a C-like source (the source for ~Christminster~, excepting the libraries that come with the compiler, is about 13,000 lines, or 440k) and outputs a ~story file~ that can be played on any of the public domain Infocom interpreters.^
^~Inform~ can be fetched by anonymous FTP from the interactive fiction archive, in the directory ~/if-archive/infocom/compilers/inform~^
^If you're completely stuck and can make no more progress, then type ~help please~, which gives access to the hints system. There are explicit hints for the first two puzzles in the game, to get you started, and vague but helpful nudges in the right direction for the remainder of the game.^
^If you're still getting nowhere, try asking for help on the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.int-fiction.^
No more hints.^
Adventure games (sometimes dignified with the name ~interactive fiction~) are a combination of second-person story and puzzle-solving game. An adventure game presents you with text that puts you in the position of protagonist, and invites you to type in commands.^
^For example, a game might start like this:^
^    You are standing in the street outside a college.^    The gate is closed.^    >^
^The prompt invites you to type something. You respond with an imperative sentence and the game tries to understand your command and to carry it out. For example, you might type^
^    > open the gate^
^and the game might respond^
^    Unfortunately, the gate is locked.^    >^
^Not to be defeated, you try something else:^
^    > knock at gate^    ~Come in!~ shouts a voice from inside.^    The gate opens.^    > go in^    You enter the college ...^
^and the game continues. Not all puzzles will be so easy, though!^
^No game can hope to understand every possible input. If you try something and the game doesn't understand, then you should try rephrasing your command or substituting synonyms for some of the words. If you've made several obvious attempts and none of them have worked, then the likelihood is that you can't do what you wanted to, and you'll have to solve your problem in a different way.^
The landscape of an adventure game is notionally divided into ~rooms~; often these really are rooms, but they can be larger places (such as streets or fields or woods) or smaller places (such as the northwest corner of the hall).^
^The name of the room you are in appears at the left of the ~status line~ at the top of the screen, and you can get a description of what you can see by typing ~look~.^
^To move from one room to another, you generally enter commands like^
^    go north^
^or just ~north~ on its own (you are assumed to be blessed with an excellent sense of direction). Any of the eight compass points may be substituted for ~north~, and in some contexts the game also understands the directions ~in~, ~out~, ~up~ and ~down~.^
^When there is a particular landmark to head for, you may be able to avoid specifying a compass direction, and instead try one of these:^
^    go through the big door^    enter phone box^    climb tree^    cross bridge^
^Sometimes movement won't take you to a new room, but will let you enter and leave objects in the current room, for example:^
^    enter car^    sit in chair^    stand on lawn^
^To leave these objects, you might type ~get out~ or ~stand up~ or ~exit~.^
^If you can get into the car and figure out how to turn the ignition on, then you may be able to drive it around; to do this, just use ~north~, ~south~, and so on. On the other hand, if you can't find the ignition keys, you might be reduced to trying^
^    push car west^
You can try to pick something up with ~take thing~ and try to put it down with ~drop thing~. The command ~take inventory~ (or ~inventory~, or ~i~ for short) gives you a list of objects that you are carrying.^
^To look at an object more closely, ~examine~ it (~x~ for short).^
^Objects may be manipulated in many ways: put into (or on top of) other objects, pulled, pushed, turned, eaten, and so on. Here are some examples:^
^    take the white rabbit^    put rabbit in the hat^    take rabbit out of the hat^    look in the hat^    unlock brass door with copper key^    open door^    offer shopkeeper the silver coin^    give gold coin to merchant^    turn the dial^    turn on the lamp^    light candle with match^    empty sack into chest^    put picture on mantelpiece^    look under the wooden desk^
^Some commands can act upon more than one object. ~take all~ will attempt to pick up all the loose items in the room; ~drop all~ will drop everything you're carrying (except for any clothing you're wearing). If you found a packing case with a number of things in it, you could type commands like:^
^    get teddy bear, rabbit and piglet^    remove everything but the brass key from the packing case^    get all the coins except gold, silver and bronze^
^If you are not explicit enough, the game will try to deduce what you meant, and if it succeeds it will tell you what it deduced. For example, in reply to ~get teddy bear, rabbit and piglet~, the game might say^
^    (from the packing case)^
^so that you know what has been assumed on your behalf. If there had been two rabbits you might have meant, it would reply with^
^    Which do you mean, the white rabbit or the Welsh rabbit?^
^You may tell it which (or reply ~either~ or ~both~ or ~all~), or else give up and do something else instead. The game can gradually accumulate information about a command, for example:^
^    > unlock door^    Which door do you mean, the big door or the small door?^    > big^    What do you want to unlock the big door with?^    > the brass key^    Which brass key do you mean, the brass doorkey or the Brass City key?^    > either^    (the brass doorkey)^    That doesn't seem to fit the lock.^
^If you don't mind which object you use, you can always say something like^
^    put a coin in the slot^
^and the game will make a sensible choice and tell you what it was.^
^Sometimes the game deduces that you wish to do something that you didn't explicitly say you wanted to. In such circumstances, it will tell you what it assumed on your behalf. For example:^
^    > give banana to gorilla^    (first taking the banana)^    The gorilla devours the banana, but it still won't let you pass.^
^The object ~it~ refers to the last thing manipulated, and ~him~ or ~her~ to the last person of the appropriate sex to be mentioned.^
^Sometimes an object will be mentioned in the description of a room purely for atmospheric value and will play no other part in the game. If you try to refer to such an object, the game is liable to respond^
^    You don't need to refer to that.^
^Your best course of action is to leave these non-existent objects alone.^
To say a single word, or a few words, to someone, you can use commands like^
^    answer yes^    say boo to goose^    ask chemist about nitrogen^    ask Einstein about the theory of relativity^    ask the police constable the time^
^and the characters in ~Christminster~ tend to be quite talkative when you approach them like this.^^To order someone about, you can use commands like^
^    police constable, give me your helmet^    jailor, unlock the cell door^    young man, go west^    Sherlock, follow me^
^though, of course, they are not guaranteed to obey you!^
The command ~read book~ will provide a quick summary of the contents of a book, but to get more information from certain texts you may have to look things up.^^To look up a single-word subject, you can type^
^    look up Julius^
^(where there is only one book you could have meant), or^
^    look up Claudius in the Twelve Caesars^    consult Suetonius about Augustus^
^Where you have a more precise reference to hand, you can try commands like^
^    read page 256 of the Decline and Fall^    look up page 7 in Pliny^    look up Genesis 14 in Bible^
To save the current state of your game into a file, type ~save~; to go back to a saved game, type ~restore~. These commands will ask you for the name of the file, so there is no reason why you shouldn't have as many saved games as you have room for on your computer.^
^To start ~Christminster~ again from the beginning, type ~restart~, and to stop playing, type ~quit~.^
^If you want to save a transcript of your game for later perusal, use the command ~script on~ to start transcription (the game will prompt you for a file name) and ~script off~ to stop.^
^The command ~score~ will give you your score, and ~fullscore~ or ~full~ will give a more detailed description of how you scored those points. When your score changes, you are notified of the fact by messages like^
^    [Your score has just gone up by one point]^
^The command ~notify off~ turns these messages off, and ~notify on~ turns them back on again.^
^Usually the game will give you a long description of a location when you first visit it and short descriptions thereafter (unless you explicitly request a long one with ~look~). If you get bored of the long descriptions, you can turn them off with ~short~ or ~superbrief~. If you're forgetful and always want long descriptions, type ~long~ or ~verbose~. To restore the usual state of affairs, type ~normal~ or ~brief~.^
^~Christminster~ displays quotations in boxes from time to time; if you don't like this feature, you can turn it off using ~quotes off~ and back on again with ~quotes on~.^
^If you regret your last command, then you can type ~undo~ to go back to the state before you typed it (you can even type ~undo~ at the ~Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE or QUIT?~ prompt after you have died). However, the ~undo~ command doesn't work on all interpreters, and you can only undo one command.^
^The commands described above don't cause things to happen in the game and don't take up any game time; nor do any commands you type which the game fails to understand.^
^Some simple typing mistakes can be correct with ~oops~ followed by the word you had intended to type, for example:^
^    take the swrod from the stone^    oops sword^
^You can repeat the last command you typed with ~again~, you can do nothing for a game turn by typing ~wait~, and you can string several commands into a single input by separating them with ~then~ (or commas, or full stops), for example:^
^    take coin. south. again. wait. put coin in box^    unwrap chocolate then eat it^
How many wrong ways are there to hide the brass key?
What is the police constable's hobby?
How many ways are there to acquire the tears?
In how many ways can the game come to an end?
Which puzzles are optional?
What names may be looked up in ~Men of Biblioll~?
What are the secret debugging commands?
How much of the background is real?
Can you answer these questions?^
^^ If you can, then you have probably played ~Christminster~^ rather more than you ought.
Christminster trivia quiz
Answer
Five. Christabel can carry the brass key, leave it on the ground, hide it in her handbag (and possibly drop the handbag), or give it to the police constable.
The police constable is clearly an ornithologist. The busker is able to distract him at a crucial moment by pointing at an imaginary bird. Try also ~show the feather to the constable~ and ~constable, arrest the busker~.

~Christminster~ is the counterpart to Oxford in Thomas Hardy's ~Wessex~ novels, and Biblioll College is the college to which Jude Fawley fails to gain acceptance in ~Jude the Obscure~ (though he later became a stonemason and in the game you can see his initials on the gargoyle). The name ~Biblioll~ puns on the real Oxford college Balliol and on the scholars' love of books and of alcohol.^
^Some of the story ideas were originally inspired by the short story ~The Ragthorn~ by Garry Kilworth and Robert Holdstock, and other elements are influenced by ~Foucault's Pendulum~ by Umberto Eco.^
^The plan of the college is based on parts of Christ's College, Cambridge, where I studied for my bachelor's degree, and the history is mostly based on that of Balliol College, Oxford, the story of the founder being that of John de Balliol. The game is set at some unidentifiable point in the postwar era, after the introduction of telephones, but long before Biblioll College admitted women (in Cambridge, colleges started the transition to co-education in about 1980, and the last men-only college surrendered, under pressure to increase its academic standards, ten years later).^
^The Egyptian history is rather romanticised, but Akhenaten was a real pharaoh, and the Osiris ritual is real too (apart from the spurious mentions of honey). The alchemy has foundations in truth; Raymond Lully, Thomas Vaughan and Eugenius Philalethes were real alchemists, who did write some of the things I attributed to them. The names of ingredients are genuine, though the things they code for are invented, as are the recipe and the nature of the elixir.^
^If you're interested in following up this part of the story, I recommend ~The Alchemists~ by Ronald Pearsall; and to demonstrate that believers in alchemy still exist, try ~Alchemists and Gold~ by Jacques Sadoul.^^Oh, and the food served at commemoration feasts is usually better than depicted here.^

You could head north to Bridge Street, south to Biblioll Street, or try to enter the college to the east.

The gate is vast and sturdy. Built of solid oak timbers and weathered by the centuries, it has witnessed the comings and goings of many generations of scholars. Above the gate is displayed Biblioll College's coat of arms, and a wicket gate is set into the bottom of the gate.
The gate is closed.
The gate is closed, but a little wicket gate stands open.

the wicket gate opens a crack and an old man 
peers out at you.

He's a tall gangling man, with long and nimble fingers.
A busking magician stands behind a folding trestle table, exhorting passers-by to come and watch his tricks. On the table are three inverted cups (one red, one green and one blue).
The busker looks at you in surprise, but then quickly recovers himself and rearranges his features into a smile.
~Hello,~ says the busker. ~How pleasant it is to have a lady as beautiful as you in my audience.~
~I've never met him,~ says the busker, ~but I'm told he has a very beautiful sister.~
~You want to know how to get into Biblioll College on a Sunday? I suppose you'll have to beg, borrow, or steal a key from someone.~
~Whenever he attempts to move me on,~ the busker confides in you, ~I show him a trick and he leaves me alone.~
~Go on,~ says the busker. ~Be a devil!~
~A magician never reveals his secrets,~ says the busker mysteriously.

~I've already done a trick with that!~ says the busker.
The busker accepts

 into small strips, then eats the strips one by one. Noticing your discomfiture, he taps 
 and says, ~Take a look here.~
The busker examines your handbag. ~Hmm,~ he says, ~this is much too big for this trick, but perhaps...~ He reaches into your handbag and pulls out a toffee, which he offers to you. ~With my compliments,~ he says, bowing slightly.
The busker peers into your handbag. ~I'm sorry,~ he says, ~but I can't find any more confectionery in here.~
The busker takes the cobblestone and brushes some grit off it. ~It's not pretty, but it'll do,~ he says.
~Why,~ says the busker, ~what a scrumptious-looking piece of toffee! This is a perfect choice.~ He accepts the sweet.
~Aha!~ says the busker, taking it. ~An excellent choice.~
You are about to offer the key to the busker when he suddenly gesticulates wildly and shouts, ~Look, a bald-headed sparrowhawk!~^^The police constable stares up at the sky. ~Where, where?~ he cries excitedly. In the confusion, the busker surreptitiously takes the brass key from your hand.
~Hmm, a strange choice,~ says the busker. He takes the feather and quickly tickles you under the chin with it.

Wistaria covers the college buildings, and in the white moonlight the gnarled branches seem to grip the old stonework jealously.
Purple-flowering wistaria covers the centuries-old stonework, and gargoyles peer down from above.

There are many places you could go into from here. Try a compass direction.
The wistaria is sturdy and certainly capable of supporting your weight, but before you can get more than two feet off the ground, the porter emerges from his lodge and shouts at you: ~Come down off there!~ Reluctantly, you obey, and the porter goes back inside.

Your heart sinks as you look around this room. It has been thoroughly ransacked: the furniture has been turned upside down and Malcolm's papers torn and scattered all over the floor. You could go back out to the second-floor landing to the west, or you could go through to another room to the south.
entering Malcolm's room
You walk through the door, expecting Malcolm to have left a note for you explaining his absence, or perhaps left a notebook describing those mysterious researches of his, but nothing prepares you for the sight inside.
You walk through the door, expecting to catch your brother hard at work and intending to amaze him with your story of how difficult it was to find him, but he is not here.
Malcolm's Study
Like Malcolm's study, his bedroom has been thoroughly searched. The bed has been broken up as if for firewood, the mattress and pillows torn apart and feathers scattered everywhere. Whatever the burglars were looking for, they wanted it a lot. A doorway leads back north into the study.
You peer around the corner, hoping to spy on Jarboe and Bungay while remaining unobserved, but just as you poke your head through the doorway Bungay looks up. ~What's this?~ he shouts. ~A spy!~^^You shrink back into the bedroom as the two men walk towards you.
You try to dart around the two men, but Bungay blocks your way with his considerable bulk. ~Not so fast,~ he says. ~We haven't finished with you yet.~
Jarboe shoves you back as you attempt to get past the two men. ~Remember what we said,~ he snarls.
Don't do it! It would be suicidal!
Now is no time for singing: the men in the next room will hear you!

^~No, I rather think she's his sister,~ says Bungay, ~Look at the family resemblance. I rather think she's come up hoping for a nice day out on the river. Well,~ and this latter is directed at you, ~he's not here. He's gone, scarpered, away.~
^Jarboe waggles his finger and points it at you. ~Just go home and forget all about your little holiday. Did you hear that?~ he asks you. ~Did it penetrate your stupid little head? Go home, keep your nose out of this.~

Bungay is a short man, at five feet and two inches a little shorter than yourself, but his vast bulk more than makes up for his lack of height. His clothes are all but bursting at the seams.
Yuck! What a horrible suggestion.
~I'm not interested in that, whatever it is,~ says Bungay without looking at your offer. ~I'm a busy man and I don't have time for trifles.~
Bungay probably weighs four or five times as much as you do. It would be madness to attack him.
~Be quiet, little girl,~ says Bungay with some distaste.

~He's a grumpy old sod,~ says the Master. ~If you do want to see him, try showing him something he's interested in, such as, say, a book of Egyptology.~
~Have you met Jarboe?~ asks the Master. ~He's our mathematics fellow, a frightfully clever chap, knows all about Riemannian manifolds and all that kind of thing. A credit to the college.~
~Have you met Bungay?~ asks the Master, ~Rather alarming exterior, but he knows his history. Specialised in the reign of King Philip IV of France, I think.~
~I wouldn't know anything about that,~ says the Master, ~It's all right over my head.~
The Master laughs at your question. ~The librarians of Biblioll College have always been a queer bunch,~ he says. ~They've always insisted they know best which books should go in the library, no matter what the Master or Fellows of the College have to say.~

~Letter Substitution Ciphers~ is a slim book, hardly larger than a pamphlet, by Dmitri Zinovic. A warning on the back cover says, ~Possession of this book may be illegal in some countries~. The content appears to describe three types of letter substitution cipher: Cyclic, Keyword and Random.
A cyclic letter substitution cipher is obtained by choosing a shift, n, between 1 and 25 and replacing each letter in the plaintext with the letter n places further on in the alphabet, wrapping round from Z to A. Thus the cipher for n=5 is this:^^
 Plaintext: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ^Ciphertext: FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDE^
^To decode a cyclic cipher with shift n, simply encode with shift (26-n); it is an easy task to try all the possibilities.^^A cyclic cipher is sometimes called a ~Caesar cipher~, because Julius Caesar used a cyclic code (with n=3) during his conquest of Gaul.
A keyword substitution cipher is obtained by choosing a fairly lengthy word or name with no repeated letters, for example ~Gwyneth~, and using G to code for A, W for B and so on. When the letters of the name are used up, use the remaining letters in alphabetical order. The cipher obtained by using ~Gwyneth~ is this:^^
 Plaintext: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ^Ciphertext: GWYNETHABCDFIJKLMOPQRSUVXZ^
^To decode a keyword cipher, you will need to guess the word the coder has chosen, or else use the methods for decrypting random ciphers.
To obtain a random letter substitution cipher, choose any random permutation of the alphabet for your substitutions. A random cipher is hardest to break, but its disadvantage is that the code is difficult to remember, and so must be written down. To decode a random cipher, your best strategy is to discover where the code has been hidden. There are also more sophisticated methods based on letter and word frequency analysis...^^The book proceeds to go into some complicated mathematics that you are unable to follow.

Professor Sir Joseph Arkwright, O.M. (b. 1882) became one of the world's authorities on ancient Egypt's Fourteenth Dynasty after leading the successful 1931-33 expedition to Akhetaten and the Valley of the Kings. Taught archaeology at Christminster until 1937, when he left to be head of the new Egyptology department at Chicago University.
John de Biblioll (1240-1279) was the Lord of Branham Castle, and a minor figure in the politicking over the accession of Edward III. He quarrelled with the Bishop of Durham, and under threat of excommunication he was forced to make a public apology. As a penance he agreed to provide for the support of a number of poor scholars in perpetuity. Thus he founded Biblioll College in 1275.
William Canynges (1435-1481) was cellarer of the college from 1472. He built the wine cellars underneath the Great Hall, and he inaugurated the custom of inscribing the cellarer's name over any new bins added during his period of office, a practice which continues to this day.
Edward Farber (1646-1695), bursar from 1682, was a good manager of money and a poor architect. He was able to raise more than five thousand pounds for the rebuilding of the chapel, and he had the good sense to hire the architect Sir William Hawksmoor to undertake the task, but it is understood that he was responsible for the ugly minaret at the top of the chapel tower.
Jude Fawley (d. 1898), a talented stonemason, was one of the team responsible for the gargoyles in First Court.
Henry Garton (1567-1641) was the architect responsible for building much of the modern First Court, including ~B~ staircase (which initially contained the junior common room and only in the 18th century was converted into rooms for fellows) and the old library. Legend suggests that the buildings contained secret passages allowing him to spy on activities in the rooms, but this seems most unlikely.
Sir William Hawksmoor (1654-1702) was one of the most influential architects of the late seventeenth century and was probably responsible in some way for almost all of the college buildings built in Christminster during that period. He was commissioned to design the new chapel for Biblioll College, his outstanding design incorporating the stained glass from the old chapel.
Thomas Heydon (d. 1512) helped to put Biblioll College on a sound footing after the poor management of the fifteenth century. He was able to increase the number of fellows to fourteen through the lease of small-holdings on college land granted by the Earl of Essex. He was the first to combine the offices of bursar and cellar, which he undertook from 1502, a joint office which survived for three centuries.
Edmund Lilly (fl. c. 1300) was one of Biblioll College's earliest chaplains. He left his illuminated Bible to the College on his death.
Modestly, the author left himself out.
There have been many Masters of the College since its foundation in 1275. You should look each one up by his surname.
Robert Mayow (1715-1770), bursar from 1752, managed to lose the college two thousand pounds, at a time when it badly needed additional finance, in a series of bungled land deals in Suffolk. In his favour, the glories of the gardens are mainly due to him.
Tobias Meldrew (1801-1870) was Professor of Theology from 1850 until 1866. He set himself the task of proving the existence of God from first principles, a task which he announced in 1860 that he had accomplished with the aid of ten thousand intermediate lemmas. The derision which greeted his attempts to publish the mammoth work eventually drove him insane, and he spent the last four years of his life in the madhouse.
Simon Noble (1631-1676), a minor metaphysical poet, was an undergraduate at Biblioll College and later a fellow of Lady Margaret Hall. Although respected during his lifetime, his work was justly forgotten after his death, and he remains most famous for his lengthy and vicious feud with Andrew Marvell.
~Eugenius Philalethes~ was the pseudonym of Thomas Vaughan (q.v.), used for his writings on alchemy.
No, no-one of that name.
Bernard Starkey (1681-1757), bursar from 1737-1752 and Master from 1752 until his death, did much to restore the failing academic reputation of Biblioll College by instituting a fellowship based upon merit, to be decided by open competition between the candidates.
Francis Tausend (1722-1801), bursar from 1770 to 1782. Responsible for the enlargement of the Great Hall and the Senior Common Room. Joined the Whigs and served four years as member of Parliament for Christminster University before famously perishing in the House of Commons in the middle of a debate on foreign policy.
Elias Tymme (1598-1670), bursar from 1640, guided the college through the difficult period of the Civil War, in which it ~lent~ one thousand pounds of silver to the King to support the war, and was taxed one hundred pounds a month to support the troops garrisoned there while Christminster was the King's headquarters.
Thomas Vaughan (1622-66) fought for the Royalists in the Civil War and returned to Biblioll College to study alchemy. He wrote books under the name ~Eugenius Philalethes~, and translated other alchemical and qabbalistic texts into English, including the Rosicrucian manifesto ~Fama Fraternitatis~.
Thomas Vauhan: another spelling of Thomas Vaughan (q.v.)
 (1625-1701), the cousin of the Earl of Lancaster, was an influential Puritan theologian and a prolific author of tracts arguing for reforms in the Church of England. He supported Parliament in the Civil War and was briefly a minister in Cromwell's government, but this did not prevent his preferment after the Restoration. He was Master of Biblioll College from 1686 until his death, but he was not liked by the Fellows and there was a persistent slander that he used witchcraft to keep one step ahead of his rivals.

The book, by Eugenius Philalethes and dated 1662, is a long treatise on alchemy (the art of turning base metals into gold and silver by the action of a mysterious substance called the ~Philosopher's Stone~) and how the author intends to produce vast quantities of gold and destroy the evil system of money, so that ~this prop and stay of the anti-Christ may come to naught~.^^The bulk of the text is a long series of recipes, in which strange allegorical names like ~Philosophic Mercury~, ~the Dew of Hermes~ and so on substitute for real chemicals.^^Near the end of the book you discover the following passage:^^~At the close of three years labour, performed with diligence, patience and good will, you will have a small quantity of a reddish powder, of a splendid vermillion, a deeper and fuller hue than cinnabar. Glorify God and be thankful!^^~To form the Virgin's Milk, which is the cause of prophetic dreams and mystic visions, dissolve the powder in a bottle of good wine, which you may give to your cellarer to put away so that it may mature in darkness over a space of at least five years.^^~Afterwards, uncork the bottle carefully, and treat the Milk by the recipe described elsewhere, to possess the Elixir of Life. It is possible to further transform the Elixir into the Powder of Projection, but I will say no more herein.~^^What a load of nonsense!

Raymond Lully (1235-1315) was a mediaeval alchemist who set out to convert the Muslims and died in the attempt. The ~Clavicula~ (Little Key) is a description of the Art of Alchemy. In it, he writes, ~This book embodies the whole of the Art, but the words I use cannot be understood by the unlearned, for the treatises are split into sections and obscure as to language.~ He's right; you cannot make head or tail of anything in the book, which appears to be utter nonsense from cover to cover.
I was expecting a page number.
The book doesn't have that many pages.
On page 364, you find a description of how to make the ~Elixir of Life~ (assuming that one starts out with a quantity of the ~Spittle of Lune~, whatever that might be). It reads:^^~Be of good heart, and pray to God for guidance in the Work. Take thou the Spittle, and in a glass retort heat it continually. First, make it sweet with the Sap of the Wood of Hermes, that is named also the Honey of the Egyptians. Second, make it bitter with the Bath of the King. Third, make it salt with the Water of the Sages, for thou desirest the spiritual elements to rise and the terrestrial elements to sink.~^^You wonder if this nonsense was what Malcolm's lab book was referring to.
You are unable to make head or tail of the material on that page, or, it seems, any other. The book appears to be utter nonsense from cover to cover.
Alas, the book has no index, and you can't find what you want.
~The Clavicula~
The Meldrews are a family of minor nobility, and this three-volume work by the Honourable Peter Meldrew is their definitive history. The book is a hastily-bound manuscript copy and the pencilled dedication from the author implies that it was never published.^^Browsing through the pages, you discover an entry on Abner Meldrew (1612-1670), who dissipated a large fortune in an insane belief in the power of alchemy to transmute lead into gold, by which power he insisted he would regain the money he had spent. He consulted many alchemists, including the famous Thomas Vaughan, and paid them much money, but they never did him any good.
You are unable to discover anything more of interest about the Meldrews.
~The History of the Meldrews (vol. I)~
A weighty work of Egyptology, Arkwright's book covers the Amarna period in ancient Egyptian history, in which the pharaoh Akhenaten, who ruled Egypt from 1358 to 1340BC, attempted to reform the priesthood of Amon-Ra and replace it with a monotheistic religion worshipping Aten, the sun-disk. Needless to say, he failed, and was deposed by the priesthood he attempted to dismantle.^^You notice that the book has been borrowed from the college library and is several years overdue.
I was expecting a page number.
The book doesn't have that many pages.
Page 143 contains a description of how Akhenaten discontinued the Osiris ritual, a yearly religious observance in which the god Osiris (sometimes identified with Sethos, who represented the dead and deified ancestors of the Pharaoh) was purified, anointed and offered honey by the king.^^You wonder if this was what Malcolm's lab book was referring to.
You discover some things you never knew about the Amarna period, but it's all very tedious and scholarly, and doesn't remain in your head for a second.
Alas, the book has no index, and you can't find what you want.
Wilderspin relinquishes the book, somewhat reluctantly.

** Error: Wilderspin doing something bizarre **
~I say,~ says Wilderspin, taking the book from your hands. ~Arkwright on the Amarna period, and a first edition too. I thought I'd never see one of these. Reminds me of the 1932 expedition, looking for stelae at Akhetaten, and listening to Arkwright's theories about Osiris. You must get me to tell you about them some time. I'm Wilderspin, by the way, pleased to meet you.~^^~Christabel Spencer,~ you reply, shaking his hand.^^~Do come in,~ he says, and he goes back into his study and proceeds to leaf through the pages of the book.
Wilderspin accepts your gift.
~I'm already pushing as hard as I can!~ he says.
~I'm not sure I understand what you mean,~ he says. ~Perhaps you could demonstrate?~
~I'll have a go, if you like,~ says the Professor. He walks over to the fireplace and depresses 
, holding it down. ~Well?~ he asks you, ~what happens next?~
~I don't think you'd be able to carry my weight,~ says Wilderspin.
~I wish I could,~ he says.
~I don't quite understand how to do that,~ he says.
~I can't go any further,~ he says.
Wilderspin takes a couple of steps in that direction. You wobble a little, but manage to regain your balance. ~That's it, I can't go any further,~ he says.
~I'm too busy to help you with that,~ says Wilderspin.
~Henry Garton was one of the college architects in the seventeenth century,~ says the Professor, ~but I don't know any more than that.~
~Like the griffins, do you?~ says Wilderspin, ~The one-eyed sort are very unusual. These are attributed to Henry Garton.~
~Edward Forbes?~ says Wilderspin. ~He has the makings of a good student, but he doesn't have the willpower to put in the work required. I suspect that he'll drift through his three years and then go off and join the Civil Service just like everyone else.~
~Arkwright had some odd ideas about the Osiris ritual,~ says Wilderspin, ~based on his interpretation of the temple paintings at Karnak and Abydos. He thought that the ancient Egyptians really believed that their offerings would bring Osiris back to life, and that they worshipped the tamarisk tree. I think he may have over-interpreted some correspondences between the cults of Osiris and of Hermes.^
^~According to Egyptian myth, Osiris was trapped by the evil god Set and imprisoned in a chest, which floated down the Nile to the papyrus swamps, where a tamarisk tree grew up around it. Later the tree was chopped down by a local king and the trunk, still containing the chest, was used as the central pillar in the king's palace.^
^~Osiris' wife, the goddess Isis, searched for him for many years. When she did find him, Set tore him into many pieces and scattered the parts across Egypt. But Isis' love was such that she visited every part and built a temple there, and Osiris was brought back to life, and reigned over the gods once more.~^
^You feel quite moved by Wilderspin's telling of the story.^
^Wilderspin adds, ~Osiris was later identified with the demigod Hermes Trismegistus, the thrice-mighty, and the tamarisk was known to mediaeval occultists as the wood of Hermes.~
Wilderspin has already told you the myth of Isis and Osiris.
~Arkwright's one of the great Egyptologists,~ says Wilderspin. ~I was with him on the 1931 expedition to the Valley of the Kings, and he was indefatigable! Blazing sun, restless natives, the competing French team of Pierre Vastang - nothing could slow him down! Of course, it was scandalous that Christminster never made him head of the department and it was no surprise to me when he left for Chicago.~
~Vastang was a menace, and no mistake,~ says Wilderspin. ~We had no end of trouble with him bribing our hired labourers to report on us and disrupt our excavations. He even dressed himself in a turban, pretending to be a Mohammedan bandit, and tried to scare us away from the Valley of the Kings by shooting at our camp. What a character!~
~That's right,~ says Wilderspin. ~Before I was appointed here, I was involved in fieldwork in Egypt. Those were the days! Blistering heat, scorpions in our boots, tons of sand and earth to move, and tombs everywhere. A paradise for the Egyptologist.~
~I don't know Jarboe very well,~ says Wilderspin. ~He's a mathematician, and all mathematicians are a bit mad.~
~Bungay's an expert on mediaeval and Renaissance Europe,~ says Wilderspin, ~which is a bit after my period, really. Don't tell anyone I said this, but I don't think anyone - least of all his students - would be unhappy if he gave up teaching in favour of research.~
~I'm not sure,~ says Wilderspin, ~but he - definitely he - looks to be about three hundred years old. I would guess from the bottles and so on that he was an alchemist, and that he feared that his researches would be discovered. Even in conservative Christminster he would have risked burning as a warlock. I wonder how he died?~
~Well, what happens next?~ Wilderspin asks you.
Wilderspin ignores you and gets on with his marking.
Wilderspin fumbles for your hand and squeezes it reassuringly. ~The best thing we can do is keep calm and think carefully about what to do.~
~I wish you'd figure out what you want me to do,~ Wilderspin grumbles. ~I don't think I can carry you for ever.~

Edward's handwriting is too atrocious to make out any more than the subject, which appears to be the cultural impact of the Fourth Crusade, and the opening paragraph:^^~The destruction of Constantinople by the soldiers of the Fourth Crusade (1200-1204) was instrumental in the bringing of Byzantine art to the houses of Western Europe, a legacy that surely inspired the greatest artists of the Renaissance. Who has not marvelled at the magnificent bronze horses in Saint Mark's square in Venice, or the great marble columns of the Venetian ducal palace? But these are the merest fraction of the treasure brought from Constantinople.~
I don't think Edward would appreciate that.
essay
Edward Forbes is a tall and slender young man, carrying with him an air of otherworldly introspection, as if he sees the concrete world through a veil of deep thought on some complex matter.

He's hard at work on his essay, and doesn't notice you.
~Hello,~ says Edward. ~Pleased to meet you.~
I wouldn't, if I were you. The shock might be too much for him.
~I wonder if my father's in there,~ says Edward, looking through the pages. ~No, no mention of him. Perhaps it should be called `Rich and Well-connected Men of Biblioll'.~
Edward takes the feather from you, and looks at it with horror. ~Oh, my poor Polly, what have they done to you?~ he says, and he starts to cry, big tears rolling down from his eyes.
Edward takes the feather from you. ~This is one of Polly's tail feathers. I do hope she isn't badly hurt,~ he says.
Edward takes the feather from you. ~Yes, this is one of Polly's tail feathers. But I don't think she's been badly hurt. More scared than injured.~
~Very interesting, I'm sure,~ says Edward, ~but if it doesn't have anything to do with the cultural impact of the Fourth Crusade or the Moorish conquest of Spain I don't think I should read it. My mind only has room for so many facts, and if I learn a new one I forget an old one.~
~Thanks,~ says Edward, taking the peanut and passing it on to the parrot, who snaps it up greedily.
~That's an excellent idea,~ says Edward. ~Peanuts are Polly's favourite food! But wait until we find her again, and then give it to me.~
~Hold on,~ says Edward. ~Let me get out of the punt first.~
~That's an excellent idea,~ says Edward, reaching for the peanut. But just at that moment, something seems to disturb the parrot, and it takes wing, flying away to the northwest.
recapturing the parrot
Edward takes the peanut from your hand and waves it at the parrot, which peers down at the morsel suspiciously. ~Come here, Polly,~ he calls, and the parrot hops up and down a little on its perch, as though the choice between freedom and food is a tricky one. Then it spreads its wings and glides down to land on Edward's shoulder, where it greedily pecks at the peanut.^^Edward beams triumphantly.
~I've already done that for you,~ says Edward. He doesn't stir from his essay.
lighting the gas ring
~I don't know about that,~ says Edward absent-mindedly, ~but I can certainly light the gas ring for you. However, I'm afraid I have no tea left, not even floor-sweepings.~ He 
moves 
 to the floor, and then 
extracts a match from his back pocket and lights the gas ring. ~There you go,~ he says, and returns to his essay.
~OK, I'll stop following you,~ says Edward, ~but I can't see my parrot anywhere around here.~
~No, you do it,~ says Edward. ~He's your brother.~
Edward goes pale. ~I'm not sure about that,~ he says in a very small voice. ~Bungay's always beastly to me.~
~No thanks,~ says Edward. ~If he sees me he'll want to know how my essay is going.~
~That's my door you're asking me to knock at,~ says Edward. ~Have you gone stark raving bonkers?~
~No-one will hear if I knock on the door,~ says Edward. ~That's what the bell-pull is for.~
~I will do no such thing,~ says Edward. ~I am a man of peace.~
~I don't think that's a good idea,~ says Edward. ~The fellows don't like to be disturbed on a Sunday.~
~Shh!~ says Edward. ~I've nearly caught Polly, don't distract me now!~
~I'm following as fast as I can,~ says Edward.
~I'll do that,~ says Edward. ~Just take me to Polly, that's all I ask.~
~I don't want to bother the Master,~ says Edward. ~Not even about something as important as my parrot.~
~Shh!~ says Edward. ~I've nearly caught Polly, don't distract me now!~
~I'm not at all sure I understand you,~ says Edward. ~Maybe you can point me in a compass direction?~
~Shh!~ says Edward. ~I've nearly caught Polly, don't distract me now!~
~Hello,~ says Edward.
~Whatever time it is,~ says Edward, ~it's probably too late for me to finish my essay.~
~I can't say I know Doctor Spencer,~ says Edward. ~Since he teaches chemistry and I'm studying history.~
~Tonight's dinner?~ says Edward bitterly. ~Oh, you mean the commemoration of benefactors. I haven't been invited. Only scholars get invited, the Master and Fellows don't want hoi-polloi like me sitting in on their revels.~
~I have to write him an essay for him on the Islamic conquest of Spain for tomorrow,~ says Edward, ~and I haven't started it yet. It's so boring, I just can't bring myself to open my textbooks.~
~I can't say I know the Master,~ says Edward. ~He holds himself very aloof, never talks to undergraduates, only to Fellows.~
~Don't mention that name,~ says Edward in horror. ~He's the bane of the life of every history student at this college and I'm in trouble with him again.~
~Don't talk to me about my essays,~ says Edward miserably. ~I have to see Professor Bungay this afternoon for a supervision, and I haven't written my essay yet. He's going to kill me, I know it.~
~Don't ask, don't ask,~ says Edward.
~I wouldn't ask me about that,~ says Edward. ~Professor Bungay gave me a gamma minus on my last essay on the subject.~
~I can't help you,~ says Edward. ~If only I'd listened harder in lectures.~
~A gorgeous creature, isn't it,~ says Edward, ruffling the bird's feathers.
~I must find my parrot, I must,~ says Edward, ~and you will help me find it.~
~I adore punting,~ says Edward, ~but I don't suppose I shall have any chance to do any today.~
~Ha ha!~ says Edward, amused at your joke. ~Of course it wasn't you, my window is at least forty feet from the ground, and you couldn't possible have thrown anything as high as that.~
~Don't ask,~ says Edward. ~It was horrible. Worse than you can possibly imagine.~ He shudders.
~I'm dreading it,~ says Edward, ~Professor Bungay is always more unpleasant than can possibly be imagined.~
~I know it looks unsafe,~ says Edward, ~but it's fine, really. There's no need to worry, I haven't set the room on fire yet.~ He doesn't sound very convincing.
Edward doesn't seem to notice you. He's obviously very distressed at the loss of his parrot.
Edward doesn't seem to hear you. He's obviously overcome by the recovery of his parrot.
Edward is so deeply buried in the writing of his essay that he doesn't hear you.
~I don't think there's much likelihood of finding my parrot there,~ says Edward.
~You might be right,~ says Edward mournfully. ~My parrot might have flown up there. But climbing the wistaria is against the rules.~
~I don't think I had better do that,~ says Edward, ~Professor Bungay might see me from his window, and then I'd be in terrible trouble because I said I'd do my essay this afternoon.~
~I've just looked there,~ says Edward sadly, ~and Polly is not to be found. And in any case, I'm not allowed to entertain women in my room.~
~If it's all right with you, I don't think I had better enter the Master's Lodge,~ says Edward. ~I always find him a bit scary. In any case, I doubt he's got my parrot.~
~I don't think Doctor Spencer would approve of my entering his private room,~ says Edward. ~But perhaps you could go in and look for me.~
~If Professor Wilderspin had my parrot, I'm sure he'd let me know about it,~ says Edward, ~and anyway, he's sure to ask me when I'm going to hand in my Ancient History essay.~
Edward goes pale. ~I'm not sure about that,~ he says in a very small voice. ~Bungay's always beastly to me.~
~I think my Polly would have had more sense than to go down there,~ says Edward.
Edward tries to open

^Edward catches sight of the parrot in the tree. ~Polly, my Polly,~ he calls. ~How can I express my gratitude at seeing you again?~ He seems overjoyed at the reunion, but the parrot is distinctly unmoved, and sits motionless in the tree.
^~Hello, Forbes,~ says Wilderspin, noticing Edward loitering nearby. ~How nice to see you! How's your essay on the Moors' conquest of Spain coming along? I expect it will be in my pigeonhole tomorrow morning, yes?~^^Edward mumbles something non-committal and says that he can't stop now, he has to get on.^
^~Well, what a surprise,~ says Bungay. ~If it isn't Edward Forbes! A man with an essay on the cultural impact of the Fourth Crusade to write by last Friday, if my memory does not fail me.~ His voice turns sour as he says, ~If you recall, we agreed that you would see me this afternoon in my room and we will have a little chat about it.~^^~Yes, sir,~ says Edward, who has suddenly turned very white.
^Edward bends down to pet the cat, which obligingly rolls onto its back and purrs. ~Hallo Turmeric,~ he says.
^~Look at that!~ says Edward angrily, pointing up at the broken window. ~Look what some cretin did to my window! Broken glass all over the floor, and my parrot gone. I don't suppose you saw the miscreant who did it, did you? No, I guess you wouldn't have done, or you would have said.~
^~Hey!~ says Edward, seeing you enter. ~You can't come in here, I'm not supposed to have women in here at all.~ When he sees that you're not about to move, he goes on: ~Well, you can come in then, but be quiet and don't tell anyone or else I shall be in terrible trouble.~
^~Please take that perfume away,~ begs Edward.
 ~My dusty, she has the nose of a bloodhound, I tell you, she can smell alcohol or perfume from a mile off.~
^^~I wouldn't worry,~ you reply, ~At least your window will be open all night.~
^~It was terrible,~ says Edward. ~I came back from breakfast and there was glass all over the floor and my parrot had vanished. I can't imagine who could have done such a terrible thing.~
^~You must help me to find my parrot,~ pleads Edward. ~Just tell me which way I should go.~
^~This is the worst thing that could have happened,~ says Edward, ~because I have to do an essay for Professor Wilderspin for tomorrow and another essay for Professor Bungay that's overdue and I haven't started either one.~
^Edward says, ~Professor Bungay said that I have to go and see him this afternoon, and he terrifies me.~
^Edward says, ~Professor Bungay is always beastly to me. He never ever gives me an alpha on any of my essays, and he always gives me bad reports so that I get into trouble with my tutor.~
^Edward says, ~I was going to do my essay this afternoon and then I was going to go punting on the river, but now I have to find my parrot.~

Baskeyfield opens the door again. ~I will not make an exception for you, no matter how often you knock,~ he says. ~If I were to let myself be persuaded into consulting with an undergraduate on a Sunday just once, then before I knew it everyone would be round here, and I'd get no peace.

A narrow hallway for Bungay's visitors to hang up their gowns and for his students to stand around nervously in as they await their supervisions.

^You try to creep through the hallway as quietly as you can, but Bungay is looking your way and you have no chance of avoiding him.^^~My God!~ he bellows, ~You little sneak!~^^You dart for the door, and he lunges after you with surprising speed, and as you get out onto the landing he catches you about the head with a swing of his fist, sending you tumbling down the stairs.^^You hear as if from far away a cracking sound that you realise only belatedly to be your head hitting the polished wooden floor at the bottom, and then everything goes black.^^You wake to find yourself in hospital with your head bandaged and Edward sitting solicitously by your bedside.^^Later, when you learn of your brother Malcolm's disappearance from Biblioll college never to be seen again, you wish that you hadn't been so unceremoniously precipitated from the scene, but by then it is too late.

Failing to hand in an essay once may be considered carelessness.~

I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear that.~

How many was that?~
And what exactly have you learned about the Fourth Crusade? Perhaps you could enlighten me.~

You clamber as quietly as you can up onto the windowsill, and for a few seconds you consider the dreadful prospect. But you must jump, and there is no time left to delay.
As you clamber up onto the windowsill, you hear voices and realise that Bungay and Edward are emerging from their conference, and that you are taking your leave only just in time!

^You can hear 
Bungay to the south, saying ~
I hope I make myself clear?~
Edward mumbling his agreement.
I shall expect to see the essay in my pigeonhole at nine on Monday morning.~^^How long will the ghastly man keep talking? You must get out of here!
Not a minute later, or else I shall have no choice but to institute rustication proceedings.~^^He is obviously coming to the end of his admonishment, and you cannot hope to evade detection for much longer.
Edward gasp with shock.^^You are getting desperate! You must escape!
Some would say that I'm being exceptionally lenient in this matter, so you should be grateful. Now begone with you, get out of my sight!~^^Any moment now, he will find you!

Still, you've created a narrow gap between the desk and the back wall of the alcove.
You can't move the desk back to where it was, because you're in the way.

The chapbook records the meetings of some society or perhaps religious order. The entries are cryptic and meaningless to you, but near the beginning there is this piece of translation:^
^~We five of the Order set forth from Paris on the sixteenth of November of the year of our Lord 1307. We were disguised as Dominicans, and Jacques kept his hood pulled over his face, although the rain was gentle, lest anyone should recognise him. We went with great fear of pursuit, for at that time seemingly the whole of the country was raised against us. But horsemen we saw none, and we came without danger to Calais, where we took ship to England, the Work safe in our hands. Friends took us in at Christminster, and there we sheltered while our brothers confessed under torture to fantastic heresies and languished in French prisons, and our fastnesses were laid open, and our treasures thieved from us.^
^~For ten years we have waited for a word, a sign, but nothing has come to us out of France. Surely one Adept has escaped the hand of King Philip? But we have waited in vain, and finally we have faced the truth. The Work we brought from France is all we have, for though we study it night and day unceasing, none now can master the Qabbala and thus become Adept.^
^~Henri quarrelled with Jacques and was expelled from the Order. Four may last a little longer than five, but now I can see in each of our faces, the thought that three - or two - or just one - could last longer still. There is a wariness about our meetings now, and I fear that I may not be long for this world. In readiness for the end, if God so wills it, I have written my last will and testament. My Bible I will give to Edmund Lilly of the scholars of de Biblioll, who has treated us with such kindness.^

Antechapel
Each flagstone is a memorial to some old member of the college. The passage of students and fellows to their devotions is wearing a path into the marble, slowly erasing this record of the past.

The chapel is a marvellous piece of seventeenth century architecture, its gracious lines giving it an elegance that's more effective (in your opinion, at least) than the Gothic complications of later, larger chapels in other colleges. There's a magnificent stained-glass window at the east end
. A large congregation is listening to the chapel choir singing Evensong
.
The clock tower doesn't appear to be accessible from here.
The antechapel is to the west.
You smell the heavy odour of incense.
You kneel and pray. If your prayer is answered, there is no sign.
Ladies do not use such language, and especially not in church.

You mustn't remove your hat in chapel.
Chapel
The window is a miracle of mediaeval glasswork. There are many scenes depicted, some from the bible, others of saints
. The morning sun streams in through the window, making the colours radiant with light
.
The scenes in the stained-glass window are so rich with detail that you'd need to spend hours going over them with a guidebook. Best to leave that for another day.

A dusty lectern stands in one corner.
On closer examination, the lectern is a beautiful work of art, sadly neglected. It is made of solid brass, and is in the form of an eagle: wings spread and talons poised as if to strike.
The lectern is made of solid brass, and is much too heavy to move.
The dust and corrosion would take more time and effort to remove than you are probably willing to devote to the task.
lectern
The Bible is a beautiful illuminated manuscript, probably mediaeval. The text is in Latin.
The Bible has been fixed to the lectern with a short chain, just in case anyone should try to steal it.
John 11:43 reads, ~Et haec cum dixisset, posuit vinum myrrheum labiis Lazari, et voce magna clamavit, Lazare, ite foras.~ Isn't Latin a beautiful language, even if you don't understand a word of it? But what could Malcolm possibly have meant by referring you to this verse?
It's all Latin to you.
^Edward says, ~That Bible is French, fourteenth century apparently. I'm afraid that I can't read a word of Latin, unless it's `veni, vidi, vici'.~^

A small area between the bustling kitchens (to the south) and the Great Hall (to the north), used for collecting dishes while a feast is proceeding in the hall.

You search among the bottles, but there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of them, all very much alike (though all exquisitely different, no doubt, once on the table). You stop searching, dispirited. Maybe if you knew what you were supposed to be looking for you would have more success.

By the River, on the West Bank
A punt floats next to the bank.
A punt is a flat-bottomed wooden boat, about five yards long and one across. It is propelled on shallow and slow-flowing rivers with the aid of a long pole.
But you have no pole with which to punt yourself.^
You gingerly push off from the bank, and 
the punt swings around as the current catches it. You flounder with the pole in the water, trying to turn the craft back onto the right heading, but you oversteer, and before you know it, you're back at the bank again, where you started out. How annoying these punts are!^
then lean all your weight on the pole. The punt jerks forward, and your feet slip on the wet wood, and you lose your balance, almost falling in. Flailing your arms, you recover your composure, but by that time the current has swung you around and you have returned to the bank again, where you started out. What a dangerous creature this punt is!^
plant your pole firmly on the bottom of the river. You give a big push, but the pole stays stuck in the mud, and your arms are almost wrenched out of their sockets as the punt comes to a halt. With some effort, you manage to extract the pole from the clutches of the river bottom, but you have made no clear progress.^
You push the punt away from the bank, but the current takes hold of it, and slowly brings it back again.
[To attempt to propel the punt, just type ~go east~ (or whichever direction you prefer)]
The punt rocks alarmingly, and it is only by sheer good fortune that you do not tread on the hem of your skirt and tumble into the river.

The pole is immensely long - perhaps four yards - and very heavy. You always find it amazing that anyone should choose such a bizarre object as a method of propulsion.

It takes two hands to lift the pole, and you're carrying too much.
There's no point in carrying the punt pole around unless you're in the punt.

It doesn't look like a good idea; how would you carry the honey around with you? Now if only you were carrying an empty bottle with you, or another suitable container...
Ever so slowly, you reach into the hive and pick up the honey-comb (how you wish you had some bee-keeper's gloves to go with your bee-keeper's veil!). By suspending the honey-comb over

^~I had the most horrible of experiences this morning,~ says Halfhide. ~I was thinking about some particularly knotty problem while sunning myself on the Green, and I suppose I must have dropped off to sleep.~
^Halfhide continues, ~I woke up to discover that a young woman had stolen my key to the great gate, but when I challenged her, she denied everything and called for help from a police officer, who of course believed every word of her story.~
^Halfhide harrumphs and continues, ~The police officer insisted on taking me to the police station and questioning me for an hour. What is the world coming to when a fellow of the college can't have a decent and peaceful nap of a Sunday morning?~
^There are general murmurs of sympathy from the assembled fellows about the over-zealousness of the local constabulary and how scholars aren't treated with enough respect.
^~You!~ says Halfhide, suddenly turning and looking at you closely for the first time. ~It was you who took my key this morning. How could you?~
^~But I didn't do it,~ you insist, glad that you're not still carrying the brass key. You smile sweetly and innocently at Halfhide, and gradually he calms down and harrumphs, and finally admits that he might have been wrong, and he might have lost his key in the long grass. You breathe a silent sigh of relief.
^Everyone is politely not looking at you, but you can tell that they're waiting for you to finish your lobster before the next course can start.
^A waiter arrives and clears away the detritus from the first course, and other waiters arrive and deposit the second course in front of you.
^~I hope you like it,~ the Master confides in you. ~Our new French chef is very gung-ho about the traditional French cuisine.~
^Wilderspin says, ~Let me tell you about a discovery I made today. That is, I should say, a discovery that Miss Spencer made today, for it was she who discovered the entrance from my study into the secret passage.~
^~That's right,~ continues Wilderspin. ~the old rumours are true, Henry Garton did put secret passages into B staircase and the library when he built them. I think it's a wonder that nobody ever surveyed the buildings and noticed the extra three or four feet of width.~
^Wilderspin says, ~I think the secret chamber was probably intended as a priest-hole; Biblioll College was at that time staunchly Catholic in despite of the prevailing religious feeling in England.~
^~I don't know if it was ever put to its purpose,~ muses Wilderspin, ~because the body we found there, which I am sure must date from the late seventeenth century, although I won't know until I go back with the experts and do a proper dating, is not a Catholic priest hiding from Puritan religious persecution, but an alchemist!~
^Wilderspin says, ~Perhaps he was afraid of being denounced as a witch, or perhaps he just wanted to keep his researches secret from his rivals. He probably died from mercury poisoning, no doubt exacerbated by the lack of ventilation in that tiny laboratory.~
^~That's amazing,~ says the Master. ~Stuck there between B staircase and the library for hundreds of years, and no-one noticed. I wonder what other secret passages there might be hidden in those old buildings?~
^~I wonder if I might inquire as to whether anyone here has read the latest University Journal?~ interrupts Bungay, but the Master is not so easily distracted from his line of thought.^^~Secret passages, ha!~ he laughs. ~That sounds like something that what's his name, the seventeenth-century Master, Lancaster's cousin, might have easily been involved in.~
^~Now the Journal -~ tries Bungay again, but the Master continues as though he hasn't heard. ~Conspiring against his own Fellows, persistent rumours of being a witch and a heretic - secret passages would have been all in a day's work to him!
^~What was it you were about to say about the Journal?~ the Master asks Bungay, but the later mutters that it wasn't important and everyone present had probably read it anyway.
^Everyone is politely not looking at you, but you can tell that they're waiting for you to finish with your food before the next course can start.
^A waiter arrives and clears away the detritus from the second course (thankfully). Another waiter turns up with a tray of small glasses and a decanter. He places the latter in front of you.
^~So what has Malcolm been up to?~ Wilderspin asks you. ~I haven't seen the fellow for a couple of days, and I thought he'd be here for the dinner.~^^You reply that you don't know where he is, and that you're very worried about what might have happened to him.
^~I spoke to Spencer on Friday,~ says Jarboe, ~and he told me that he had been summoned at very short notice to a conference in Edinburgh to speak about his work, and that he was very sorry that he had to rush off before he could get in touch with Miss Spencer.~
^~But what were you doing in his rooms today?~ you ask, ~And who ransacked them?~^^~Good grief, how terrible!~ exclaims the Master. ~What happened?~^^~I didn't have a chance to tell you this,~ says Bungay. ~Spencer's rooms appear to have been burgled. We discovered this only this morning and of course we telephoned the police.~
^You are about to protest at Bungay's blatant untruth when you catch Jarboe's eye and shrink under his baleful and hostile glare. It doesn't seem as though anything you might say could dent the plausibility of this pair of liars.
^~When will Spencer be back, Jarboe?~ asks the Master. ~I don't think he'll be very happy at the news.~^^~I don't know,~ says Jarboe. ~He didn't say how long the conference would be.~
^~Ahem,~ says the Master, looking at you meaningfully. You gather that something is expected of you.
^~Tell me, Miss Spencer,~ says Halfhide, ~Do you know the Bishop of Bath and Wells?~
This plush room is crowded with the fellows of the college, talking loudly and drunkenly. None of them affect any interest in you.
The door to the kitchens is now shut.
^The Master stands up, and that seems to be the signal for the dinner to end, because everyone else gets up too, and makes for the various exits. You fetch your possessions from the cloakroom and return to see the last of the fellows climbing the stairs to the senior common room.^^~We're off up for a few drinks,~ the Master says to you before he goes. ~I do hope you'll join us.~^
^Jarboe whispers something to Bungay, but you are unable to catch his words.
^Bungay mutters something to Jarboe, but you are unable to catch what he says.
^Halfhide and the Master speculate about the candidates for the Provost of Saint Stephen's College.
^The Master complains about the declining standard of undergraduate entrants to the college.
^Wilderspin speculates about the likelihood of Biblioll College ever going co-educational. Halfhide is sceptical, and the Master says that it will never happen while he is Master. ~Excepting present company, of course,~ he says, ~women are not capable of the academic workload that Christminster demands of them.~
^Wilderspin and Bungay discuss the latest candidates for election to Fellowships at the British Academy, and their chances of success.
^The Master ruminates on the long history of these Commemoration dinners.
^Jarboe talks about the plans to expand the mathematical syllabus.
^Halfhide compliments the Master on the excellent quality of the food.
^The Master talks about the necessity of attracting more undergraduates to Biblioll College. Jarboe thinks that this must be done by improving academic standards, but Halfhide suggests that a good result from the rowing team would be more successful.
^Halfhide reminisces about his exploits in North Africa with Monty.
^Wilderspin talks about his plans to put together funding for an expedition to Aswan. The Master wonders if that wouldn't be a bit dangerous at the moment, given the international situation.
Great Hall
Displayed prominently on High Table is the College's collection of plate.
This collection of tableware is meant for admiring rather than eating off: here we have Henry II's gold christening cup, Charles I's mead horn, the Bishop of Gloucester's silver communion cup, and many other treasures.
You're a guest here, and it isn't polite to steal your host's valuables.

Master of Biblioll College
Jarboe is a tall, gaunt man, with thin, ungainly limbs and a long sharp nose. His suit hangs loosely from his narrow shoulders.
Doctor Jarboe
Bungay is a short man, at five feet and two inches a little shorter than yourself, but his vast bulk more than makes up for his lack of height. His clothes are all but bursting at the seams.
Professor Bungay
Wilderspin is tall and bewhiskered, and you might guess his age to be about fifty.

Doctor Halfhide
It's rude to pick up your food.
FoodClass
You look at the lobster. It stares back unnervingly. It looks like it will be a tough battle, and you are not altogether sanguine of the outcome.
You'll have to say precisely how you intend to go about that.
A rich fishy smell emanates from the lobster's innards.
Alas, the thick shell of the lobster is perfectly adequate to protect it from your feeble attempts to eat it.
eating the lobster
To your surprise, the lobster is excellent.
lobster
It is a U-shaped piece of metal. A screw runs through holes in the ends, connecting them together.
You'll have to turn the screw before you can remove the widget from the lobster.
You turn the screw, and the ends of the widget separate.
You turn the screw, and the widget clamps onto the lobster. Relentlessly, you keep on turning until the lobster's shell snaps with a loud crack. A rich smell comes from the lobster's innards. Success!
You turn the screw, bringing the ends of the widget together.
The widget is already attached to the lobster.
The widget won't fit around the lobster.
You slide the widget until it encircles the lobster.
widget
An ordinary wine glass.
You don't want to get broken glass everywhere.
You pour a little of the wine onto your plate, in the path of the snail. It's hard to tell, but you could swear that the snail went right ahead and lapped it up!
glass
A pleasant bouquet.
You've already drunk too much wine, and you have a distinct feeling that if you drink any more, you'll be sick.
You drink a little of the white wine, and it is very pleasant. But no sooner have you put your glass down than it is re-filled.
wine
It is rude to pick up your plate.
china plate
It is a large and unappetising mollusc, with a shell perhaps two inches in diameter. 
Something about the way it oozes across your plate tells you that it is not dead yet.
It oozes across your plate in a haphazard and drunken manner.
It lies helpless on its back, its soft innards exposed to you.
The snail glues itself firmly to the plate and you cannot budge it.
It is rude to pick up your food.
The snail retreats into its shell and grips the plate firmly, and you are unable to get at it. Now if you could turn it over so that its soft parts were exposed, maybe the odds would be more in your favour.
Somehow, the idea of eating a live animal doesn't appeal to you.
The snail's shell is proof against your feeble attack Now if you could turn it over so that its soft parts were exposed, maybe the odds would be more in your favour.
A better weapon might help you.

You plunge 
 into the snail, and it perishes messily.
The snail grips the plate firmly and you are unable to budge it.
Using the knife and fork, you turn the unresisting snail onto its back.

The port wine smells very sweet and very strong.
You've already drunk too much, and you have a distinct feeling that if you drink any more, you'll be sick.

Wax candles provide flickery light.
You've already stolen as many candles as it is prudent to steal.

It's cool and breezy up here on the tiles of the college, and you have an excellent but somewhat alarming view of First Court, and of the college flag flying above the Great Gate. You could attempt to descend the wistaria, or follow a narrow ledge to the south.
A precipitous drop prevents you from getting closer to the clock tower.
The only safe way out of here to follow the ledge to the south, but you could also try descending the wistaria.
Surely you still have something to live for?
Roof of the Master's Lodgings
A fearsome stone gargoyle crouches by the gutter.
It's an ugly creature, its face perhaps a caricature of a past Fellow of the college. The initials ~JF~ have been carved neatly into its hindquarters.
The gargoyle's gaping mouth points down, so it's hard to see how to pour 
 into it.
 That's probably just as well; the gargoyle doesn't look as though it would be very friendly.
The gargoyle stoically endures your attack.
gargoyle
The flag flutters in the breeze, and you can make out the college coat of arms: three lions rampant and a silver cup.
You can't reach the flag from here.
flag
You are on a narrow ledge on the roof of Biblioll College. Tiled roofs slope up to the east and west, and the ledge runs to the north. To the south, a metal ladder descends into an enclosed space between the college buildings.
The roofs are too steep to climb.
You climb down the ladder.^
The Roof of ~B~ Staircase
ladder
A small space enclosed on all sides: a college staircase to the north, the kitchens to the east, the library to the west, and a tall brick wall to the south. A rickety metal ladder ascends the building to the north, and ugly weeds grow all around.
The manhole is closed.
You crawl on hands and knees back into the library, and shut the secret entrance behind you.^
Small Courtyard
The cover is metal, and so old that its surface is peeling with rust. There is a keyhole to one side.
^An open manhole leads down into darkness.
^There is a closed manhole in the centre of the courtyard.
That would fall through into the tunnel.
Not while you're standing on it!

A secret entrance to the library leads west.
The secret entrance is very low, perhaps a foot and a half high, but you crawled through it one way, so you're sure that you can crawl back.
secret library entrance
You are standing on uneven wooden floorboards in a dark tunnel. A little light enters from a hole in the roof and the tunnel leads into darkness to the east.
The tunnel goes on for a long way, perhaps fifty yards, and you grope your way carefully through the gloom.^
Tunnel
The rotting wooden walls of this gloomy tunnel drip with moisture. It continues to the west, but to the east there's a door.
You grope your way back along the long tunnel.^
The door swings shut behind you. You grope your way along a dark passage, before finding your way blocked by a curtain, on the other side of which you can hear voices.^
You encounter a barrier of some kind that blocks your passage further east.
Tunnel
The door is made of the same wood as the tunnel walls, and has been going slowly rotten for a long time.
The rotten wood is soft enough that you are able to screw the corkscrew deep into the door.
There's no handle.
The handle comes off in your hand and disintegrates into flakes of wood.

You remove the corkscrew from the door.

From behind a thick curtain, you look upon a dark underground room, dimly lit by arrays of flickering candles. Thick tapestries cover all four walls, apart from an open doorway to the east.^^In the centre of the room, your brother Malcolm stands on a chair, his feet and hands tied, and a tight noose around his neck is attached to the ceiling. Jarboe and Bungay are here, dressed in long white robes. The scene fills you with horror, but you dare not move or protest lest you be heard.^^A dark hole leads west.
The tapestries are burning so fiercely that you cannot leave that way. You must use the door to the east, or perish!
Anxious to escape the dreadful scene, you make your way back along the passage, but to your horror the rotting door is locked! There is no escape that way.
Shh! Jarboe and Bungay would surely hear you!
^** Error: player escaped from the crypt **^
^Jarboe pulls a dagger from his robes and waves it in Malcolm's face. ~Tell us the truth,~ he hisses.
^~I've told you,~ Malcolm says hoarsely, ~I don't know what you mean. It was just a game ... a silly idea ... there's no elixir.~ He is clearly having difficulty talking.
^~You're lying,~ shouts Bungay. ~You're trying to keep the secret for yourself! We tried your so-called recipe and it did not work. This is your last chance to tell us the truth.~
^~My God!~ croaks Malcolm. ~You really believe it ... you are insane, both of you ... what is this farce? Who are you?~
^~We are Knights of the Holy Temple,~ intones Bungay solemnly. ~The guardians of the Qabbala and the wisdom of Jerusalem!~
^Malcolm laughs feebly. ~Knights Templar! Elixir of life! Ha ha! What a pair of clowns you are!~
^~How dare you?~ screams Jarboe, and with a vicious kick, he knocks the chair away from under Malcolm, who gives a strangled cry and then falls silent, slowly swinging from the ceiling.
Bone-dry from years in this underground room, the tapestries have gone up in flame like kindling.
This underground chamber is lined with thick tapestries, now all ablaze. Fire runs up the walls and across the ceiling. The heat is oppressive, and the smoke stifling. If you don't escape soon, you will surely perish!
^Jarboe stares aghast at what he has done. ~I didn't mean...~ he begins.^^~You fool,~ cries Bungay. ~You utter utter fool! What have you done?~ and in a rage he rushes at Jarboe, fists swinging. The two of them fall clumsily together onto the floor, knocking the candles over onto the tapestry, which quickly catches fire.^^Suddenly there is a terrible high-pitched scream from the brawling men, and then Jarboe stands up, blood dripping from his dagger. He stares at it, as though he cannot believe that he has just killed two men, and then he flings it aside and runs out through the doorway to the east.
^The fire quickly takes hold of the bone-dry tapestries, and spreads around the room.
^The fire continues to spread.
^The rafters have caught fire, and the flames are creeping across the ceiling.
^The heat is oppressive.
^The flames continue to creep across the ceiling.

~What's that?~ says Bungay, hearing the movement. Before you can react, he pulls the tapestry aside and grabs you roughly. ~My God!~ he shouts. ~What have we here? A spy!~ and his crazed face is the last thing you see before you faint mercifully into unconsciousness, never to awaken...

That gaping wound at his throat needs more attention than you can provide. And it may be cruel to say so, but you're glad that the horrible man is dead.
You beat at Bungay's burning robes, and manage to quell the flames for long enough to pick his pocket. You retrieve a silver key which is almost too hot to hold. You briefly wonder if Jarboe knows about this key.
There's nothing else to find in Bungay's pockets.

Jarboe blocks your way.
You struggle through the door into a dim room strewn with expensive furniture. Your strength is failing and your lungs are full of smoke, and you are so dizzy you doubt you can move another foot. You are on the verge of blacking out when a pair of dark helmeted shapes loom over you. It is the police constable and a fireman with him! Never has such a sight been so welcome!
 You manage to retain consciousness long enough to say, ~My brother! Help him!~
 Then the fire and the smoke and the shock are suddenly all too much for you, and you pass out...^^You awake a long time later in hospital, recovering from third-degree burns
saving Malcolm from the fire
. Malcolm is sitting by your bedside. ~Christabel!~ he says. ~How glad I am to see you! I could hug you for joy, but the doctor says I mustn't touch you yet.~^
, with Edward sitting solicitously by your bedside. You ask him what happened to Malcolm, and he is very reluctant to answer. Finally you force him to admit that 
although everything was tried to resuscitate him, Malcolm is dead.^
Malcolm's body was recovered from the wreck of the college, almost too badly burned to identify.^
^Later, you learn that Edward had gone to Bungay's room that night to hand in his essay. Smelling smoke, he raised the alarm, and the porter rang for the fire brigade, who smashed down the door of Bungay's room just in time to save you.^^The fire destroyed almost the whole of ~C~ staircase before they were able to put it out. Jarboe's charred bones were found in the wreckage of the secret staircase, and nothing at all was found of Bungay
, but this is no consolation to you.
. No-one has any explanation for the bizarre behaviour of Jarboe and Bungay; if such explanation ever existed, then it has surely now gone up in flames.
The roaring of flames is very loud.
Top of the Secret Staircase
Doctor Jarboe stands here.
Jarboe is a tall, gaunt man, with thin, ungainly limbs and a long sharp nose. He is dressed in a long white robe, and his eyes stare madly at you.
~Give me that,~ says Jarboe.
Jarboe ignores you. He looks so crazy now that you are not even sure that he hears you.
^Jarboe rushes at you, knocking you head-first down the stairs. The last thing you see is his boot descending onto your face.
Jarboe reaches for your dagger, trying to disarm you, but you slash at him. He screams, and clutches at his injured wrist
.
. ~Let me by,~ he yells. ~Let me by, I must fetch the key, or we'll die in here.~ You stand aside, still pointing the knife at him, and he runs past you down the stairs into the blazing crypt.
Jarboe grabs the dagger. ~Fool!~ he shouts exultantly, and stabs you in the chest. The last thing you hear is his insane laughter.
~Aha, the key!~ shouts Jarboe exultantly, grabbing it. He unlocks the door and slips through it. You start after him, but he shoves you back and starts to shut the door. You put every ounce of energy you have left into trying to hold the door open, but Jarboe is too strong for you, and with a dreadful cackle he shoves the door closed and locks it. You can hear his laughter on the other side of the door disappearing into the distance until you are alone with the crackling flames.
^Jarboe throws his weight against the door in an attempt to break it down, but without success. ~The cretin!~ he shouts, ~He locked the door on me!~ Then he hears your footsteps and whirls around. ~You again!~ he screams, ~This is all your fault!~^
^Jarboe rushes at you, knocking you head-first down the stairs. The last thing you see is his boot descending onto your face.
^He looks as though he is about to attack you, but then he stops. ~I see you have the key to the door,~ he says. ~Give it to me!~
^He looks as though he is about to attack you, but then he stops. ~Give me the knife, little girl,~ he says softly. ~You shouldn't be carrying such a dangerous thing.~
^You don't fool me,~ says Jarboe. ~I know you have the key. Give it to me so I can unlock the door. It wouldn't do for us both to die here.~
^~Give me the key,~ Jarboe says again, ~I won't hurt you.~
^~Give me the knife, little girl,~ Jarboe says again. ~I won't hurt you.~
