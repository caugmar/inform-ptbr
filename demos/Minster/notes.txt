Bugs/Suggestions
----------------

The square brackets contain the category of the bug and the date on
which the bug was fixed.  The categories are from "The Errors of TeX" by
Donald Knuth, printed in "Literate Programming":

    B blunder - typed X when I meant to type Y
    F forgotten function - I hadn't written an essential piece of code!
    G generalisation - a major extension to the program
    M mismatch - hadn't used the correct interface to the library
    P portability - a change to make it run on more systems
    A an algorithm was fundamentally incorrect
    S surprise - two parts of the program interacted in an unexpected way
    D data structure was not kept consistent
    T typographical error - mispelling, poor grammar or punctuation
    Q quality control - an input produced an incorrect response, or
      some feature of the background was inconsistent
    I interactive improvement - a new or improved response to some input

A bug that has not been fixed is prefixed with an asterisk (this tends
to be the case when the bug is in a tricky part of the library parsing
routines).

   1 (MK) DefaultTalk shouldn't select the parrot at the window.
     [S 27/5/95]

   2 (MK) The Busker shouldn't show you the cup if you've just looked
     under it.  [Q 27/5/95]

   3 (MK) Busker does trick with last trick object (e.g. the telegram)
     rather than with the marble, if you just wait for him.  [D 27/5/95]

   4 (MK) Looking under cup at earliest moment means that busker's next
     comment is not very meaningful.  [Q 27/5/95]

   5 (MK) The map isn't recognised properly in the prologue.  [D 27/5/95]

   6 (MK) `ask constable for helmet' gives no reply.  [I 27/5/95]

   7 (MK) The constable's "Morning, ma'am," says the constable, "Lovely
     day!"  seems to prompt the reply "yes" which then gets a lame
     response.  [Q 27/5/95]

   8 (MK) `get all from y' doesn't work (probably my hack in Parser.h
     failed).  [A seems to work with real libraries 27/5]

   9 (MK) `show cobble to constable' gets inappropriate message
     [Q 27/5/95]

  10 (MK) >give key to porter Who do you mean, the ring of keys or the
     brass key?  [Z parser bug, kludged 27/5 - asked Graham to look at
     it]

  11 (MK) Cabinet is takeable [F 27/5/95]

  12 (MK) If Edward is asked about things about which he does not know
     after he has seen the feather, some response other than "He's
     obviously very distressed..." would be appropriate.  Even if it is
     just "I don't know about that" or something.  [no - this is a
     misunderstanding on MK's part - maybe solved by giving E more
     responses?]

  13 (MK) >ask master about malcolm "That's all very well," says the
     Master, "but anyone could tell me that. Can't you show me some
     proof?" [Q 27/5/95]

  14 (MK) If Edward is led into Biblioll Street, perhaps he should react
     to the broken window.  [I 27/5/95]

  15 (RD) When playing with the busker, sometimes the telegram doesn't
     quite move around.  [Q 27/5/95]

  16 (RD) It isn't clear to me how I can see the key that the don is
     lying on, but not slip it out from underneath.  [Q 27/5/95]

  17 (RD) For the stick of candy, after given to the constable, "(given
     away)" might be more appropriate.  [I 27/5/95]

  18 (RD) Some way of differentiating notes would be appreciated.
     [I 27/5/95]

  19 (RD) In "B" staircase, second floor, "ladder" would be an
     appropriate scenery word.  [I 27/5/95]

  20 (RD) "hear" may not be the right word in "Edward doesn't seem to
     hear you." [Q 27/5/95]

  21 (RD) In Malcolm's bedroom, "look out window" might be a good touch.
     [I 27/5/95]

  22 (RD) I can knock on Wilderspin's door (b2), ask him about
     Arkwright, then leave to the First Court; and while I'm there I'm
     still told, "Professor Wilderspin says..." [D 27/5/95]

  23 (RD) TelephoneDaemon is confused as to which of states 1,2 is
     Jarboe and which is Bungay.  [D 27/5/95]

  24 (RD) Perhaps Forbes should react when I knock on his door (b5) when
     he's nearby, and when I look in his pigeonhole.  [Q 29/5/95]

  25 (RD) I should be able to close the door to Malcolm's study from the
     inside.  [Q 29/5/95]

  26 (RD) It isn't obvious from the descriptions when the door to the
     Second Court is open.  [I 29/5/95]

  27 (RD) In the darkness of the Cellars, attaching the power pack to
     the meter gives me the 5.0V message, when the dark should prevent
     that.  [Q 29/5/95]

  28 (RD) The hatch is broken - sometimes its open and you can't go
     through it, sometimes you can go through it while the cellars are
     dark, sometimes Edward follows you (into darkness) [D 29/5/95]

  29 (RD) ">put tears on altar" yields "An interesting idea. The altar
     is closed." [D 29/5/95]

  30 (RD) "go east" doesn't work in punt.  [M 29/5/95]

  31 (GN) The verb "time" (standard in many games for "what is the
     time") ought to be recognised, if only to be more eloquently
     refused.  [I 29/5/95]

  33 (GN) The table being described twice at Bridge St is a bit naff.
     Probably my fault (i.e. a library change since you wrote the
     introduction), still.  [Q 29/5/95]

  34 (GN) Um, "candy" is a bit of an Americanism.  If this is a toffee,
     why not say so? [Q 29/5/95]

  35 (GN) I'm slightly narked that, having got the policeman to take
     part in the candy trick, I then let the trick finish because it was
     fun to watch, and now he's eaten the candy and is following me
     again - if I didn't know this puzzle from the sampler version, I'd
     be really stuck.  Perhaps the policeman could give the busker a
     whistle (say) in order to see the trick again, having been hooked
     on it once.  [I 29/5/95]

  36 (GN) "give map to policeman": Perhaps he might look at the map, and
     annoyingly tell you how to get to the front gate of the college
     (which you already know).  [I 29/5/95]

  37 (GN) There really should be a "tickle someone" form of "tickle", to
     give a better reply when you type "tickle man".  [no - because the
     "what do you want to tickle that with?" is a valuable clue to the
     syntax]

  38 (GN) "copper" is not recognised for "policeman".  Peeler?  Bobby?
     [I 29/5/95]

  39 (GN) When the don shouts "You there!" etc., the constable's arrival
     message may precede him, so that "he shouts at you" is ambiguous -
     change it to "the don shouts at you".  [Q 29/5/95]

  40 (MK) It's unclear that you have to give the bag to the busker (he
     says he wants objects like coins, watches etc).  [29/5/95]

  41 (MK) thought that Edward wouldn't speak at all until you'd given
     him the feather.  [no - see #12]

  42 (RD) Make it clearer that the eyes pop back out.  [Q 29/5/95]

  43 (RD) In Wilderspin's study, "x griffins" should perhaps be allowed.
     [I 29/5/95]

  44 (RD) "put book in fireplace" (also in river) [I 29/5/95]

  45 (RD) Edward comments on Bible even when not there.  [D 29/5/95]

  46 (RD) When escaping from Bungay's study through the window, perhaps
     a message of relief would be appropriate ("You've escaped -- and
     just barely!"); and to be able to refer to the window after leaving
     from it seems fair.  [I 29/5/95]

  47 (RD) Edward doesn't seem to move about properly after his meeting
     with Bungay: he seems to remain in Bungay's hallway even though the
     description suggests he has gone.  [D 3/6/95]

  48 (RD) Why is "feel gum" so silly? ("No chance." "Don't be silly!"
     ...) [Q 29/5/95]

  49 (RD) In the darkness of the secret room, this message is printed
     twice: "I wish you'd figure out what you want me to do," Wilderspin
     grumbles, "I don't think I can carry you for ever." [Q 29/5/95]

  50 (RD) In the Secret room, with the skeleton and bench, get the
     "Wilderspin doing sth bizarre" error.  [D 29/5/95]

  51 (MK) "get key" seems a bit rude as a way of getting the tin key.
     If you would like to throw in a verb, how about "point to".  As in
     "point to ring".  Of course, you then have the problem of players
     wanting to point to everything...  [I 29/5/95]

  52 (MK) wants to jump to his death [no]

  53 (GN) Why don't I know my own surname? [Q 15/10/95]

  54 (GN) "porter, where is malcolm" or "porter, where is he" produced
     "no reply". (The Master is just as annoying.) [I 29/5/95]

  55 (GN) In "A" staircase, ground floor, north ought to equal up.
     [I 29/5/95]

  56 (GN) Call me a traditionalist (go on), but for some reason I prefer
     capitalised location short-names (e.g. "Master's Lodge" rather than
     "Master's lodge"), as uncapitalised ones look too much like
     incomplete sentences.  [I 29/5/95]

  57 (GN) Incidentally, you might call this the Master's Lodgings rather
     than Lodge (which the porters inhabit) - such is the practice at
     Magdalen, anyway.  [I 29/5/95]

  58 (GN) When the Master's maid opened the door to the lodge, I tried
     "in" but without success.  Perhaps you might trap this one case
     (since in this one case "in" is unambiguous).  [I 29/5/95]

  59 (GN) "kiss master" might have been a plausible thing for a young
     lady to do to a nice helpful respectable old chap in the 50s.  (And
     indeed in his 50s.) [I 29/5/95]

  60 (GN) Might I ask for just slightly more description on the
     staircase rooms?  The carbolic scent of cleaning, the view out over
     the roofs from a small window, the feeling that you don't quite
     belong here, etc., must be the very essence of Cambridge, sorry,
     Christminster.  [I 29/5/95]

  61 (GN) "look under door" (the library door) might say something?
     [I 31/5/95]

  62 (GN) Recognise "bricks" as well as "brickwork" there [I 31/5/95]

  63 (GN) It just occurs to me - can you work the phrase "sporting one's
     oak" into the game somewhere?  This is to do with when one's outer
     and inner doors are open or shut, and has certain connotations, as
     you doubtless recall.  [I 2/6/95]

  64 (GN) I may misunderstand this, but why does the voltmeter have only
     one terminal, the clip?  Surely it measures potential difference?
     [Q 10/6/95]

  65 (GN) "put voltmeter clip on power pack" seems reasonable to me,
     too.  [I 31/5/95]

  66 (GN) I tried to shake hands with Edward.  [I 31/5/95]

  67 (GN) "edward, go to second court", "edward, second court", "edward,
     bridge street"...  When he said "who could have done such a
     terrible thing", I tried to confess, "edward, me", "edward, it was
     me".  [I 31/5/95]

  68 (GN) Can I call Edward "ed"? [I 31/5/95]

  69 (GN) solve the smell/smell thing problem once & for all; then
     "smell" in First Court calls <<Smell Wistaria>> (and so on)!
     [M 31/5/95]

  70 (GN) "edward, pull bell" doesn't work.  [I 31/5/95]

  71 (GN) The porter is unimpressed by being shown a map of the College.
     Now one thing porters do react to is people who are lost.  [I
     2/6/95]

  72 (GN) This being the 1950s, Edward would have been strictly
     forbidden from having a female visitor in his rooms - perhaps this
     might make an amusing rejoinder to "edward, east" at the top of the
     second floor of B.  [I 31/5/95]

  73 (GN) Perhaps you might change the library message of "You hear
     nothing unexpected" to, oh, "Christminster is so restfully still on
     a Sunday"? [I 31/5/95]

  74 (GN) The analogous archway at Magdalen is a war memorial, a rather
     moving long tablet of names and regiments along both walls.
     [I 31/5/95]

  75 (EKC) Evensong in chapel (need to be wearing a hat to get in).
     [3/6/95]

  76 (EKC) Flag and coat of arms.  [I 2/6/95]

  77 (EKC) College plate at high table? [I 2/6/95]

  78 (GDR) Master doesn't talk to you when you enter his study.  [D
     2/6/95]

  79 (GDR) "ask master for arkwright", "ask master for books" [I 2/6/95]

  80 (GDR) History of the Meldrews (vol. III).  [I 2/6/95]

  81 (GDR) Hiccups (cured by drinking water).  [I 2/6/95]

  82 (MK) J & B ask me to leave and then won't let me leave.  [Q 2/6/95]

  83 (MK) It is possible to get a bit ahead of Bungay.  [S 2/6/95]

  84 (MK) "You leave the pole behind in the punt for the next person who
     comes this way." is odd if you're not in the punt.  [D 2/6/95]

  85 (MK) "look up 143 in arkwright", "read page 143 in arkwright".
     [I 2/6/95]

  86 (MK) Response to "ask M about W" does not really make sense if you
     have not already asked the Master for Arkwright (which I had not
     done, so I did not know what book was meant).  [Q 2/6/95]

  87 (MK) What if you knock at the door before B arrives? [Q 2/6/95]

  88 (MK) "give/show lab book to bungay" should be more disastrous than
     it is.  [no - indicates he's not so observant]

  89 (MK) Is it deliberate that the initial description of Bungay's
     study does not mention the window? [Q 3/6/95]

  90 (MK) The sequence of their conversation should continue even if I
     just stand in the hallway and wait.  It only seems to proceed if I
     keep typing "l".  [I 3/6/95]

  91 (MK) What if you knock on Bungay's door while Edward in there?
     [Q 3/6/95]

  92 (RD) It's not clear how I escaped the dark room arrived at by
     pulling the lever: "go down" doesn't do anything, but "sit on
     floor" does? [M 3/6/95]

  93 (RD) The Master should perhaps say something other than "You've
     convinced me..." when shown different books.  [Q 5/6/95]

  94 (GDR) Trap "go north" in Bungay's Study.  [M 3/6/95]

  95 (RD) After escaping the hidden rooms, Wilderspin's fireplace still
     indicates the west exit is there, when it's not.  [D 3/6/95]

  96 (GDR) Can walk on lawn now.  [I 3/6/95]

  97 (EKC) Flag.  [I 3/6/95]

  98 (GDR) Remove connection between Gardens & West Bank [D 5/6/95]

  99 (MK) Some of the spiel that Edward gives in the first few turns
     after he is discovered is not relevant after his supervision.
     [Q 4/5/95]

 100 (RD) You observe that two wires (one green, one red and one blue)
     are plugged into the blue socket.  [A library bug - "fixed"
     17/10/95]

 101 (RD) "get parrot" -- when it's on Edward's shoulder [I]

 102 (RD) "fill retort with water" results in "** Error: object out of
     place: water store **" etc.  [A 5/6/95]

 103 (RD) Missing new-line in "x retort" -> "... It contains some cloudy
     water." [T 5/6/95]

 104 (RD) "fill bottle with water" -> But the brown glass bottle already
     contains a nothing.  [A 5/6/95]

 105 (RD) "put water in retort" -> "You don't want to go losing things
     in the river, do you?" [A 5/6/95]

 106 (GN) I can't look up Master in Men of Biblioll.  [I 5/6/95]

 107 (GN) I tried to thank the master for the invite, but couldn't.
     [I 5/6/95]

 108 (GN) Could the M. say "always good to see you" rather than "Nice to
     have met you" on subsequent departures? [I 5/6/95]

 109 (GN) The porter is unimpressed by being shown the ticket.  (I had
     hoped he might unlock the 2nd Court door.) [no - tough luck]

 110 (GN) And I would mention that I didn't put an email or snailmail
     address into my game, since these files will lurk on bulletin
     boards _forever_.  There are still copies of Curses Release 7 out
     there that I occasionally hear of.) [no]

 111 (GN) "The cleaning ladies" - as referred to when smelling in B
     basement.  Um, it just occurred to me it would be witty to invent a
     name for these, along the lines of "bedder" or "scout".  Perhaps
     "dusties" has the right precious, somewhat patronising ring to it?
     [I 6/6/95]

 112 (GN) In the 50s, of course, everyone smoked.  Perhaps the Master
     might offer you a cigarette?  (Which, being a delicate young thing,
     etc., etc.) [no - worries about fire &c]

 113 (GN) I'm not sure "take all from cabinet" ought to unplug the plugs
     from the sockets - surely that's not what I intended.  And you can
     fix this by exempting the wires from "take all" using
     ChooseObjects()...  [I 5/6/95]

 114 (GN) The "you can see a cabinet, in which are..." etc. message is a
     bit less than helpful when trying to discover which wire is in
     which socket.  Particularly since "examine wires" doesn't tell one
     this either.  [I 5/6/95]

 115 (GN) It is slightly annoying that after attaching the voltmeter to
     something, one has to examine it as a separate action.  After all,
     you're looking at the wretched thing already, so it would be hard
     not to take a reading.  [I 5/6/95]

 116 (GN) "hang up phone" is unrecognised.  [I 5/6/95]

 117 (GN) "put phone on ..." [I 5/6/95]

 118 (GN) The College was founded in 1275; but you say it is 700 years
     old.  [Q 5/6/95]

 119 (GN) "look through door" might do something interesting at the 2nd
     court door, through which chinks of light can be seen.  [I 5/6/95]

 120 (GN) I was hopeful of finding something under the name of Spencer
     (or perhaps of Baskeyfield) in the library card-index - in most
     colleges, fellows are morally obliged to give copies of all their
     books to the library.  [no]

 121 (GN) Does the Master not have a lodge pigeonhole? [no - after all,
     he doesn't at Christ's]

 121 (GN) "You must help me to find my parrot," pleads Edward, "Just
     tell...." is wrongly punctuated; the second comma should be a full
     stop.  This slight grammatical misdemeanour recurs in Edward's
     dialogue.  [T - this appears at least 173 times, but all done
     5/6/95]

 122 (GN) Wouldn't a history student be at all impressed by seeing Men
     of Biblioll? [I 6/6/95]

 123 (GN) I have found Wilderspin, but find him unresponsive.  "ask
     wilderspin about edward" might be nice? [no - misunderstanding]

 124 (GN) I am slightly annoyed that Men of Biblioll has been not even
     entertaining yet, since apart from Biblioll himself absolutely no
     proper nouns have been revealed yet - despite being all over first
     court.  Couldn't there be a discreet statue somewhere, or something
     like that?  A "Bloggs Room"? [no]

 125 (RD) "open cabinet" -> "You open the cabinet, revealing three pair
     of sockets[...]" [Q 5/6/95]

 126 (RD) "look at wires" -> "Which do you mean, the pair of green
     wires, the pair of red wires or the pair of blue wire?" [Q 5/6/95]

 127 (RD) Would "hang up" be an acceptable synonym for "replace
     telephone"? [I 5/6/95]

 128 (RD) In Wilderspin's study, you might want to remove the griffins
     and eyes from the scope of "get all". Maybe.  [Q 5/6/95]

 129 (RD) When I arrive in the library from the secret room, perhaps
     Edward should respond with one of these messages, but not both.
     [Q 5/6/95]

 130 (RD) This message appears just after the parrot has landed on
     Edward's shoulder: "Edward stares up at his parrot forlornly. "Come
     here, Polly," he calls, though not with any conviction that he is
     going to be obeyed." [D 5/6/95]

 131 (RD) In "Archway Between the Courts", perhaps "Between" shouldn't
     be capitalized.  [T 5/6/95]

 132 (RD) I can still hear voices or engaged tones on the telephone
     after I've dropped it by leaving the Master's Lodgings.  [D 5/6/95]

 133 (RD) "look at red socket" -> "The pair of red socketsis empty."
     [T 5/6/95]

 134 (MK) "look up lilly in men" [I 6/6/95]

 135 (MK) "look up canynges in men" has two "to this day"s - awkward.
     [T 6/6/95]

 136 (MK) "There's nothing within reach to the up." [Q 6/6/95]

 137 (MK) After "wilderspin, drop me", he doesn't go back to his script.
     [D 6/6/95]

 138 (MK) "jump" while standing on Wilderspin.  [I 6/6/95]

 139 (GN) "red cup" and "red brick wall" clash.  [Q 6/6/95]

 140 (GN) "But I don't have your key" => "But I haven't got your key"
     [T 6/6/95]

 142 (GN) "look in index for maclane?" [I 6/6/95]

 143 (GN) Why can't I call "Men of Biblioll" "maclane" after it's found?
     [I 6/6/95]

 144 (GN) Bungay and Jarboe would not call each other Dr and Professor,
     certainly not in the 50s (when, to be strictly chronological, the
     term Dr wasn't widely used around Oxbridge).  It would just be
     Bungay and Jarboe.  [I 6/6/95; 11/7/95]

 145 (GN) "hide under bed" doesn't work ("bed" object doesn't exist).
     [I 6/6/95]

 146 (GN) "floozie" is a bit modern, isn't it?  Can I supply "Always
     knew he had garlands in his hair"? [T changed to 'floosie' 6/6/95]

 147 (GN) "slap" = "attack" [I 5/6/95]

 148 (GN) You might sneakily mention last night's rain at the Lady
     Margaret Green location.  [I 6/6/95]

 149 (GN) "x chapel/hall/cobbles" [I 6/6/95]

 150 (GN) I feel a little less happy about the 2nd court description
     than the 1C one; the menu-look is a bit less pleasing, and the rest
     is slightly too plain. The Hall and Chapel must be splendid, so
     tell us about them! [I 6/6/95]

 151 (GN) cant_go in second court [I 6/6/95]

 152 (GN) Antechapel suggestion: the flagstones in antechapels tend to
     be engraved tombstones or memorials. Might be a good place to hide
     a (possibly spurious) Man of Biblioll.  [I 11/7/95]

 153 (GN) The altar is too plain.  [I removed it 6/6/95]

 154 (GN) Couldn't we at least have the first few words of the Latin
     Bible, fiat lux and all that, when read? [I 6/6/95]

 155 (GN) The lectern is also a bit plain; "get lectern" [I 6/6/95]

 156 (GN) "look up john in window" for individual stories of saints [no]

 157 (GN) "pray" [I 7/6/95]

 158 (GN) "smell" in chapel, antechapel.  [I 7/6/95]

 159 (GN) up in AC/C say sth about the inaccessibility of the Tower?
     [I 6/6/95]

 160 (GDR) make the antechapel NW of the SC.  [I 6/6/95]

 161 (GN) improve GC description, plus add portraits.  [I but no
     portraits 7/6/95]

 162 (GN) Door to the SCR? [I 7/6/95]

 163 (GN) Feelings of terror at being trapped in the cellar are somewhat
     assuaged by gaining a point in the process (a consolation which is
     seldom apparent in real life).  [I moved score to end of cellars
     6/6/95]

 164 (GN) "bang on door/hatch/etc" should do the same as "knock on ...".
     [I 6/6/95]

 165 (GN) "bin one" and "bin 1" for "first bin", please.  [I 6/6/95]

 166 (GN) "the practice that" bit of Canynges's entry could be better
     expressed.  [T 6/6/95]

 167 (GN) Could Tausend be MP for Christminster University, not for the
     town?  (An arrangement that was only abolished post-war, I
     believe.) [I 6/6/95]

 168 (GN) Replaced version of FullScore that lists your achievements in
     chronological order.  [I 7/6/95]

 169 (GN) I was hoping for a cameo appearance by Baskeyfield after
     knocking on his door.  If only "Library hours are such and such, as
     you well know".  [I 11/7/95]

 170 (GN) Fatuous point: the Ahketaten stelae weren't really excavated,
     as they were carved into cliff-sides and still visible.  [Q 6/6/95]

 171 (GN) Wilderspin ignores asking about jarboe or bungay.  (He might
     "prefer not to comment on his colleagues"?)  He doesn't respond to
     "honey" either, which is a pity.  [I 7/6/95]

 172 (GN) When you get a book from the card index, you might set "itobj"
     to the book fetched.  [Q 6/6/95]

 173 (GN) I was just wondering if Simon Noble (if he's a real poet, I'm
     embarrassed, as I've not heard of him) would be in Men of
     Biblioll... but no. (make up a visit?) [I 7/6/95]

 174 (GN) I don't believe archaeologists have ever been admitted to the
     Royal Society. How about OM instead of FRS? [Q 6/6/95]

 175 (GN) "ask wilderspin about vastang/ceiling" [I but no ceiling
     7/6/95]

 176 (GN) "in" should do for "enter hole" [I 6/6/95]

 178 (GN) I can't get Wilderspin to get on me in similar fashion.
     [I 6/6/95]

 179 (GN) The way W. disappears on the ledge is deeply disconcerting, as
     I then can't go anywhere and don't even get an interesting cant_go
     message.  [Q 6/6/95]

 180 (GN) "listen" ought to give something interesting in the dark
     places.  [I 7/6/95]

 181 (GN) How does W. know that my name is Christabel? [I 6/6/95]

 182 (GN) "search bench" [I 6/6/95]

 183 (GN) "bottles" is unrecognised, although W. guesses something from
     them.  [I 6/6/95]

 184 (GN) "fellow" ought to be recognised as a name for numerous
     characters.  [I 6/6/95]

 185 (GN) C Staircase is a little plain.  [I 7/6/95]

 186 (GN) Yes, I really think your parrot could have got through a
     locked wrought iron gate, Edward.  [I 6/6/95]

 187 (GN) When the power pack is plugged into the box, this isn't
     revealed in LOOK descriptions.  (Same for the voltmeter.) [Q 6/6/95]

 188 (GN) It is still not entirely clear that when one gets the wires
     from the cabinet, they are unplugged but not taken.  [Q 6/6/95]

 189 (GN) "look inside mouth" (of the wrought iron lion) might provoke a
     reply, perhaps along the lines of "Anyone can tame an iron lion."?
     [no]

 190 (GDR) check for "it" throughout [Q 7/6/95]

 191 (MK) "touch south wall" in secret passage.  [I 7/6/95]

 192 (MK) one should not be able to turn on the light switch in the

 193 (MK) In the Well, "w" doesn't produce the "crawl" message.
     [D 6/6/95]

 194 (MK) ... didn't like the peanuts implementation.  [Q 7/6/95]

 195 (RD) "put widget in/on/under/over lobster" [I 7/6/95]

 196 (RD) At night, climbing the wistaria after dinner, the message gets
     printed twice.  [Q 7/6/95]

 197 (RD) get a candle -> You can't see any such thing.  but get candles
     -> You pick up one of the candles.  [Q 7/6/95]

 198 (RD) get malcolm -> I don't suppose Malcolm's body would care for
     that.  [Q 7/6/95]

 199 (RD) pull malcolm w -> Is that the best you can think of? [I 7/6/95]

 200 (GN) the voltmeter logic is incorrect - what if power pack
     connected to one box wire and volt to another? [Q 9/6/95]

 201 (MK) problem with "say x" near phone (disambiguation fails).
     [Q 11/7/95]

 202 (MK) obscure bug where "ask master about xxxx" fails miserably [no]

 203 (RD) Teasing about the Knights Templars in the proto-blurb and the
     ending seemed a bit overblown.  [I 17/10/95]

 205 (RD) It would have been nice for Edward to respond to being shown
     some of the history books, even if it was "that's not my field".
     [I 11/7/95]

 206 (RD) Be more consistent about which objects open the shed and scare
     the bird.  [no]

 207 (GN) If I try to put something in the hatch from below, the game
     says "that would fall through".  [Q 9/6/95]

 208 (GN) At the Well: "climb south wall" != "climb brick wall" [Q
     9/6/95]

 209 (GN) The well itself, being the thing for which the location is
     named, ought at least to have an examine message? [Q 9/6/95]

 210 (GN) "descend wistaria" isn't in fact recognised, despite the "Roof
     of Master's Lodge" description [I 9/6/95]

 211 (GN) Could the game be suitably scathing in reply to "tickle
     gargoyle with feather"? [I 9/6/95]

 212 (GN) "gate" is unrecognised here.  [I 9/6/95]

 213 (GN) By my reckoning, east of the Well is not the Great Hall but
     the Kitchens, since I'm standing more or less at the south wall of
     the College.  Also, surely the most visible thing from the roof of
     the Master's Lodge ought to be the Chapel tower, which isn't
     mentioned? [I 9/6/95]

 214 (GN) If Hawksmoor's chapel includes the stained glass from the old
     chapel, why is it described as Renaissance glasswork?  It must
     surely be earlier? [I 9/6/95]

 215 (GN) "ask master about chapel" [I 11/7/95]

 216 (GN) Too many locked doors.  [no]

 217 (GN) Game gets gradually less populated.  In the Second Court area,
     for instance, there's really only the Cook to interact with.  A
     Chaplain (or a Dean of Divinity) might liven things up there.  Or,
     I don't know, perhaps some undergrads rehearsing for a play, or
     something like that.  [I - added cat 11/7/95]

 218 (GDR) improve movement-checking, using x_to and initial routines.
     [P 11/7/95]

 219 (RD) is getting the Skery book optional? perhaps a funnier joke
     [I 16/6/95; 11/7/95]

 220 (MK) hit B4 should = knock at b4 [I 16/6/95]

 221 (MK) capitalise "Evensong"? [I 16/6/95]

 222 (MK) "which I am must date" (endgame.inf) [T 16/6/95]

 223 (MK) About giving the elixir to malcolm: perhaps "pour elixir into
     malcolm's body" would be reasonable.  [I 16/6/95]

 224 (GN) Bungay's Hallway description (pedantic point about): "stand
     around nervously in" would be slightly better grammar.  [T 16/6/95]

 225 (GN) Oh, from C staircase ground floor, S actually goes U, which
     I'm sure you don't intend.  [Q 16/6/95]

 226 (GN) When you jump from Bungay's window, Why not close the handbag
     en route? [I 16/6/95]

 227 (GN) The crack (in the garden shed door) is too narrow for the
     corkscrew, is it? [no]

 228 (GN) "push elm", "shake elm" [I 16/6/95]

 229 (GN) The word "fish" isn't recognised here (as verb or noun).
     [I - noun only - 11/7/95]

 230 (GN) "You get into the punt" is a somewhat plain description of an
     invariably traumatic process for anyone wearing a dress.  [I
     16/6/95]

 231 (GN) 2nd attempt at punting "east": three sentences in a row start
     with "You", which is a little heavy.  [T 16/6/95]

 232 (GN) Why shouldn't I try to punt "north" or "south"? [I 16/6/95]

 233 (GN) Come to that, how about recognising "punt east"? [I 16/6/95]

 234 (GN) Edward "beings" the punt to rest (presumably "brings").
     [T 16/6/95]

 235 (GN) Small topographic point: how does the river flow out of
     College?  Through a culvert in the wall?  This is not mentioned on
     either side.  [I 11/7/95]

 236 (GN) Plath - sequence of four bee-keeping poems (The Bee Meeting,
     etc.) about a young unprotected girl overcoming her morbid horror
     to collect honey? [I 12/7/95]

 237 (GN) "Hey!" says Edward, seeing you enter... he continues, "Well,
     you... -- is I think fractionally doubtful grammar; the comma after
     "continues" should be omitted, or replaced with a colon.  [T
     16/6/95]

 238 (GN) I'd like to be able to read a snatch of his essay, over his
     shoulder. Though he's the type to have awful handwriting.
     [I 11/7/95]

 239 (GN) "Damn," says Jarboe.  "The stupid phones are playing up
     again." -- This is just a tad weak for 50s don dialect.  "How
     singular," says Jarboe.  "These damn-fool phones are playing up."
     [I 16/6/95]

 240 (GN) "uncork" is unrecognised [I 16/6/95]

 241 (GN) Shouldn't the pale liquid at least bubble to indicate being
     heated? [Q 16/6/95]

 242 (GN) Oh, tiny point - Edward's door is labelled Mr Forbes, which
     he'd only rate if he were an MA.  How about "Forbes, E. St C." or
     some such? [I 11/7/95]

 243 (GN) Tearing the veil somewhat reminds me of the veil of the temple
     being rent in twain, which is John something:something.) [I 12/7/95]

 244 (GN) Anyway, from Bungay's study, OUT or D should leave via the
     open window; and the window ought to be callable "windows" (as in
     "open windows").  [I 16/6/95]

 245 (GN) "get all" in the gardens includes the clock tower, which is a
     little surreal.  [Q 16/6/95]

 246 (GN) If I: (i) light the ring, (ii) put the retort of pale liquid
     on it, (iii) add honey from the tamarisk tree's hive, (resulting in
     a bubbling liquid) (iv) pour Edward's tears into the retort, then I
     get an ** Error: impossible mixture of liquids occurred! **. The
     same occurs if I add the bubbling mixture to the tears.  [A
     11/7/95]

 247 (GN) If I take the retort off the ring, to get a sticky gum,
     pouring the tears in results in an abruptly ending sentence.
     [A 11/7/95]

 248 (GN) "listen" clearly ought to say something unusual.  "listen to
     choir" is understood but "listen to chant" isn't.  [I 16/6/95]

 249 (GN) I still can't "pray", nor can I "kneel" or even "sit", "join"
     or "enter" the congregation.  [I - pray - 16/6/95]

 250 (GN) At least I'm back in the game.  You might make Edward remark,
     when the perfume arrives, that at least his window will be open all
     night.  (One more pang of guilt.) [I 11/7/95]

 251 (GN) "put widget on lobster", "put lobster in widget".  [I 16/6/95]

 252 (GN) When Halfhide (nice touch, btw) and the Master speculate about
     candidates, perhaps you might have a Provost or President rather
     than a Master, just for variety? [I 16/6/95]

 253 (GN) "perfectly adequate proof against" sounds wrong to me;
     "perfectly adequately proof against" perhaps (proof against is
     irregularly an adjective, not a noun, here, so the rest should be
     an adverb), but it's not really a happy phrase.  [T 16/6/95]

 264 (GN) The gold plate contains "many other trasures".  [T 16/6/95]

 265 (GN) At this point I tried to "knock wine" (Don't be silly!) and
     "spill" it (unrecognised) - anything for a distraction.  [I
     11/7/95]

 266 (GN) My first attempt to "turn snail upside down" failed.  How
     about "turn snail over"? [I 16/6/95]

 267 (GN) "pour glass of port" or "pour a glass of port" should work (a
     pain to implement, I know) [no]

 268 (GN) The verb "pass" is not even recognised! [I 16/6/95]

 269 (GN) "fellows" is unrecognised.  So is "wax".  [I 16/6/95]

 270 (GN) It was never made clear where or how I got my possessions back
     (unless I missed it).  [I 16/6/95]

 271 (GN) Does the Master not stay for dessert?  And is the housekeeper
     still on duty at this point? [D 16/6/95]

 272 (GN) By the River, on the West Bank: at night, there's a space
     missing between "north" and "glittering".  [T 16/6/95]

 273 (GN) I tried listening in the Tunnel; "Christminster is restful and
     quiet on a Sunday night" would seem preferable at this hour.
     [I 16/6/95]

 274 (GN) Why would nothing be gained by pouring the elixir on the
     gargoyle?  I was hoping to reanimate it, so that it could push
     through the door.  [I 11/7/95]

 275 (GN) You might recognise "arras" as a synonym for "tapestries".
     [I 16/6/95]

 276 (GN) As Gothic as this is, why can't I set fire to the tapestries
     myself?  That was my first inclination to get them off Malcolm.
     [I 13/7/95]

 277 (GN) I don't quite understand the point of pushing Bungay's desk!
     But perhaps you could rig it so that if you do, the lacquer box
     falls off (to draw attention to it slightly).  [no]

 278 (GN) Hanging very Hardy-esque.  [no - I agree]

 279 (GN) First, Jarboe dies in a slightly over-vague way at the moment
     Somehow I expected a further confrontation with him, and for this
     reason I the end felt a little premature.  [G 11/7/95]

 280 (GN) Secondly, Edward ought to come back into things, or even
     Wilderspin [I 11/7/95]

 281 (GN) Finally, I'm not totally sure how the fire brigade found their
     way into the secret courtyard.  Did they look up Hawksmoor in the
     library, or climb the wistaria?  Why are they concerned with this
     obscure annexe at the back of college, when the Great Hall is
     ablaze?  After all, nobody knows you're there.  [I 11/7/95]

 282 (GN) Could you add a few Templar motifs to Bungay's rooms, perhaps?
     Perhaps to round out his hallway.  The whole Templar business comes
     in only for one line near the end.  [I 17/10/95]

 283 (GN) It seems reasonable to try and reanimate Thomas Vaughan with
     the elixir, too.  At one point I thought that was the plan.
     [I 11/7/95]

 284 (GN) It would be nice if the Chapel, or the Chapel tower, were to
     come into the game a little more than they do.  [no]

 285 (SB) "constable, give me the key" goes wrong if constable doesn't
     have the key.  [D 14/7/95]

 286 (SB) "turn don over" [I 14/7/95]

 287 (SB) asking the busker about magic, trick, and tricks [I 14/7/95]

 288 (CG) "volunteer" as a verb; distinguish "take cup" from "look under
     cup" (i.e. say sth about putting it down) [I but no volunteer
     14/6/95]

 289 (CG) "sit on man" in LMGreen [I 14/7/95]

 290 (CG) message for constable arriving at Bibioll street missing?

 291 (CG) ask {constable,busker} about {constable,busker,don} [I
     18/7/95]

 292 (RD) From the Great Hall, Turmeric stalks off to the north, when
     the actual exit seems to be northeast.  [Q 17/7/95]

 293 (CG) better error message for "look up thing" [I 17/7/95]

 294 (CG) A "pull wires" results in the standard message "It's fixed in
     place."  Should be plural.  [Q 17/7/95]

 295 (CG) The porter lets me rummage through everybody's mailbox even
     before he knows who I am.  [I 17/7/95]

 296 (CG) Edward seems a rather weak character to me.  Why doesn't he
     wander around on his own? [G 18/7/95]

 297 (BW) call the constable a 'cop' [I 17/7/95]

 298 (BW) Ask Busker about cups doesn't work [I 14/7/95]

 299 (BW) Wanted to say "yes" to busker, also "volunteer"; suppose this
     means I should rewrite the busker's spiel [I 18/7/95]

 300 (BW) "little" is a bad adjective for the wicket gate.  [T 17/7/95]

 301 (BW) "turn over x" for "turn x over" [I 17/7/95]

 302 (BW) "lift up cup" [I 17/7/95]

 303 (BH) "examine me" [no]

 304 (BH) After giving the constable the toffee, "constable, give toffee
     to me" works but "ask constable for toffee" doesn't.  He could give
     the same response to "constable, knock gate" [I 18/7/95]

 305 (BH) "take helmet from constable" works; so does "take cape from
     busker".  [D 18/7/95]

 306 (GDR) put Robert Skery clue into phone call.  [I 18/7/95]

 307 (SB) can't get another toffee after constable ate it [D 20/7/95]

 308 (SB) directions wrong in Antechapel description.  [T 20/7/95]

 309 (CG) In the cellar, "take all" followed by "third" is responded to
     with "But it isn't there now." [S - Inform library parser problem,
     corrected in 5/11]

 310 (CG) Should shed door give the "It seems to be locked." message
     since there's no keyhole? [I 26/7/95]

 311 (CG) "slide door" -> (into the door)(first taking the door)
     [S 26/7/95]

 312 (CG) "remove hinge" -> (first taking the door) [I 26/7/95]

 313 (CG) The parrot gets startled if I "throw feather at parrot."
     [I 26/7/95]

 314 (CG) Maybe "I'm coming" when knock at Bungay's door.  [I 26/7/95]

 315 (CG) I can only go n/s in the punt? [Q 26/7/95]

 316 (SS) In PC's descripiton, "stocky" usually implies short [T
     26/7/95]

 317 (SS) You can't examine the cobblestone when you're at Chapel Street
     [I 26/7/95]

 318 (SS) "Second Court is a wide rectangular expanse of cobbles,
     surrounded on all four sides by tall buildings.There are many
     exits: to the west, a low wooden door" [T 26/7/95]

 319 (SS) "It is made of solid brass, and is in the form of an eagle,
     wings spread and" (change comma to colon).  [T 26/7/95]

 320 (CG) dropping peanut in punt gives "It rolls away on the ground out
     of sight." (paraphrased) [I 26/7/95]

 321 (CG) If you ask master about dinner after you have the ticket,
     there is a word missing from his reply.  [T 26/7/95]

 322 (CG) In some of the garden, the directions are very sparse.  In
     particular, the arboretum description doesn't say which way you can

 323 (CG) Could you implement "dip retort into river"? [I 26/7/95]

     of the garden, passed Ed in the second court, but didn't say
     anything to him. A few turns later the error started appearing
     every turn or so. I don't know where he was stuck. It also happened

 396 (JF) There are a couple of windows in the game, in the "B"
     stairwell, and the "C" stairwell that I felt I should be able to
     fool around with.  Maybe say "that window was painted shut years
     ago, and even the porter can't open it."  [I 17/10/95]

 397 (JF) I got stuck and tried to put the elixir on the skeleton.
     Anyway, the game responded " the skeleton isn't interested in
     that". [I - give now for any noun - 15/10/95]

 400 (KH) When I got into Malcolm's room and closed and locked the door
     behind me, found his lab book and was stupid enough to loose it to
     Bungay, I followed Bungay and Jarboe. I got out of Malcolm's room
     and wanted to close and lock it - but it allready was locked.  [no]

 401 (PS) If Christabel knocks on Wilderpin's door even while he's in

     [M 15/10/95]

 405 (BM) I also got off track because it seemed like the first time I
     pressed the left eye it did something different, so I spent many
     turns running about trying to figure out what the eyes had actually
     done.  [I added click to text - 15/10/95]

 406 (BM) Most cats I know (even scarred-up ones with missing ear bits
     :-) tend to move real quick when they're kicked, especially if you
     kick it 3-4 times.  [I 15/10/95]

 407 (RD) I should mention, should the author read this, I got a funny
     response several times.  It started out with something like 'Bad
     optional num' and then gave the correct response.  This was with
     'look up (name)'. [P - ITF bug, not mine]

     decay."  [A 15/10/95]

     wires in the same socket?"  [I 17/10/95]

 420 (DA) why is Arkwright (who was born in 1892) in MacLane, which only
     goes up to 1900?  [Q 18/10/95]

 421 (DA) Another point: I assume that one must use Edward to get past
     the stuck door in the archway (at least, Christabel can't open it
     by herself, but Edward can go through it) but there's no mention of
     Edward opening the door when C. follows him east.  [no]

 422 (GDR) Tamarisk tree mentioned by name in Bee-Loud Glade description
     [B 18/10/95]

 423 (JD) Busker should be more helpful if you try to give an object at
     the wrong time.  [I 18/10/95]

 424 (GDR) Make the help screens work if screen isn't wide enough?
     (i.e., just have a pretty/plain feature that selects the v3 help
     menus or the v5 help menus)  [P 22/10/95]

 425 (JN) In several cases in which Walthamstowe's name appears, the
     error message "Bad Optional Num" was prepended.  [P 24/10/95]

 426 (JN) When I attempted to "stand on manhole" in the Small Courtyard
     without having unlocked the manhole, the game responded that I
     couldn't because the manhole was in the way.  [Q 23/10/95]

 427 (JN) In Malcolm's room, Jarboe and Bungay take turns telling
     Christabel to leave.  If you try to leave when they tell you to,
     they say, "Don't walk away on me."  Can't quite seem to make up
     their minds.  [I 23/10/95]

 428 (JN) I tried hiding in the gap between Bungay's desk and the wall
     to no avail.  [I 23/10/95]

 429 (JN) When I came back out of the gap, the game said, "You're on
     your own two feet again."  Had I ever left my feet?  [I - fixed by
     library 5/12]

 430 (JN) Lying on the desk is the same as hiding in the gap.
     [I 23/10/95]

 431 (JN) In the Secret Room, if you ask Wilderspin to examine the
     skeleton, the game responds that he has better things to do, when
     in fact all he's doing is looking at the skeleton.  [Q 23/10/95]

 432 (JN) In the Tunnel, if you don't have light, you can't go east
     because the door is in the way.  However, you can't actually see
     the door or manipulate it in any way.  It would be more effective
     if, before the player has actually seen the door, the game said
     only that you run into a barrier of some sort.  [Q 23/10/95]

 433 (JN) I visited the Master before going up to Malcolm's room.  As
     the Master had said that Malcolm was in Edinburgh, it was perhaps
     strange to find upon entering his room that I expected to catch
     Malcolm hard at work.  [Q 23/10/95]

*434 (JN) When I tried to "show telegram to man" in the porter's lodge,
     the game responded, "You can only do that to something animate."
     [S - library bug - "man" added to porter 23/10/95]

 435 (CO) One of the cellarers' first names -- the second cellarer, I
     think -- is John in the wine cellar and Thomas in the history book.
     [T 23/10/95]

 436 (MP) When you leave the passage and reenter the library you are
     told that you now close the passage. Well, if I instead go up the
     roof and climb down the wall and go back into the library the
     normal way the passage should then still be open and it should be
     possible to command Edward to go east into it.  [Q - description
     improved - 23/10/95]

 437 (GDR) Make sure that people know they're climbing down from the
     roof to get to the courtyard.  [Q 23/10/95]

*438 (GDR) Give it to <thing not understood> produces the error "You
     can't see "it" at the moment".  [S - library bug]

 439 (NQ) When one is visiting the Master, asking for the newspaper
     sometimes get the same response as asking for a book: "Yes I know
     but which one?"  [Q 24/10/95]

 440 (NQ) (on the roof) Typing *n* generates the response "It is
     impossible to get any closer to the clock tower" but typing *enter
     clock tower* generates the response "the clock tower is too far
     away."  [I 24/10/95]

 441 (JA) "throw pole at parrot" shouldn't work!  [Q 24/10/95]

     [I 24/10/95]

 443 (MR) The message you get trying to give the elixir to the skeleton
     is a bit strange.  [I 25/10/95]

     which isn't portable to some Infocom interpreters. [P 17/11/96]

 447 (SG) "search X for Y" and "find Y in/on X" = "look up Y in X".
     [I 17/11/96]

 448 (MG) Also "check X for Y", "lookup Y on/in X", "find Y on/in X"
     should do the same.  [I 17/11/96]

 449 (DA) If MacLane is in the handbag and you try looking someone up,
     it says "you can only read the title" but gives you the entry
     anyway. [M 17/10/96]

 450 (KW) "search malcolm" -> Malcolm's body probably wouldn't
     appreciate that.  (Before Malcolm is resurrected.)  [Q 17/11/96]

 451 (GDR) Cellar no longer works properly if you hide in the alcove;
     the cook comes back. [D 17/11/96]

 452 (LH) I tried to stick Jarboe with the pin (at the endgame) and got
     a bug: my hands were full, so the dagger was automatically put in
     my bag, and then *Error: dagger not found in player* was
     printed. [S 17/11/96]

 453 (GDR) If Edward is forced (via "forbes, <direction>") into the Senior
     Common Room, the player will get periodic messages: ** Error:
     Edward in location where he can't move **  [F 17/11/96]

 454 (KW) "search malcolm" -> The Malcolm probably wouldn't appreciate
     that.  (Forgot proper attribute.)  [Q 17/11/96]

 455 (DK) Books can be consulted in darkness.  [Q 17/11/96]

 456 (NS) `Open bottle' when the corkscrew is in the handbag replies
     that you don't have the corkscrew.  [I 17/11/96]

     [no]

 458 (NS) Some suggested syntax for the cellar: search third bin for
     stamp, compare brown bottle with third bin, look for stamp in third
     bin.  [I 17/11/96]

 459 (NS) AMUSING reports a point for "moving Bungay's desk", but you
     actually acquire it for getting his chapbook.  [Q 17/11/96]

 460 (RB) The bible can be opened but not closed.  [I 17/11/96]]

 461 (RB) It should be explained why only one verse from the Latin bible
     is printed (because of the code).  [Q 17/11/96]

 467 (JW) "But there are merest fraction ..."  (these).  [T 17/11/96]

 468 (KW) Make the hatch more attractive to knock at?  Or try shouting?
     [Q 17/11/96]

*469 (KF) Phones don't work: It has to go phone-box-wires-sockets-phone
     company for the solution to make any sense.  Therefore, the meter
     has to register on the wires, not the sockets.  In fact, there is
     another bug.  The solution will work even if the green wires are
     completely unplugged.  This cannot work for a p-b-w-s-pc solution
     as above.  Otherwise, when you lift the master's phone, you should
     hear nothing.  [I agree with this, but it's too late to make the
     phones technologically convincing.  Think of it as black magic.  I
     know I do.]

 470 (DT) look up spencer -> I only understood you as far as wanting to
     look.  [no]
