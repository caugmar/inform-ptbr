CHRISTMINSTER SOURCES
---------------------

"Christminster" is an adventure game, written by Gareth Rees using
version 5.5 of Graham Nelson's programming language Inform and version
5/12 of the Inform libraries.  In order to compile Christminster, you
must apply the supplied patches (grammar.h.patch, parser.h.patch, and
verblib.h.patch) to the three version 5/12 library files.  Under Unix,
use the commands

        patch grammar.h grammar.h.patch
        patch parser.h  parser.h.patch
        patch verblib.h verblib.h.patch

These files are provided for interest only; no effort has been made to
make the code readable, understandable, clear, well-documented and so
on, except for the bare minimum necessary to keep the program in a state
where it could be maintained.

Apart from this file and the ten Inform source files, the collection
includes the following:

        COPYRIGHT        Copyright details pertaining to the whole
                         collection.
        notes.txt        List of bugs found and suggestions made during
                         playtesting and after the first release.
        minster.rec      Script of commands that wins the game with
                         maximum points.
        offcuts.txt      Code that never appeared in the released
                         versions, but which might be interesting.

        grammar.h.patch  Patches to version 5/12 of the Inform libraries
        parser.h.patch   needed for "Christminster" to compile correctly.
        verblib.h.patch
