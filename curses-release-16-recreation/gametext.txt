Austin is quite unruffled.
For some reason, Austin is startled and springs for his life 
right up through the south wall and into Alexandria!
You feel your brain turning to rice pudding.

Rod
You are knocked off your feet with the power of one of the High Rods, but it is too puissant for a mortal such as you are.
It is searing hot!  Even with the gloves on you cannot touch the adamantine.
It is searing hot, and you cannot touch the surface!
Warning (once only!): the three High Rods seem to balanced extremely delicately on the edge of the pit.
An adamantine rod, bearing a sculpted 
hand

 on one end, and inscribed with its title.
(Interesting choice.)^^As you take it, you upset the balance and the other two High Rods rattle away down the crystal passageway into the underworld.
HighRod
Oh dear. Like Mad Isaac before you, you have spontaneously combusted!
You don't really want to vapourise Austin.
The bones jerk and rattle, but seem unable to come together into life.
The adamantine knight leaps up, invigorated by the fire in his skeletal eyes, a new spark in his belly!  He bows gravely, in the elaborate style of a mime artist.
Adamantine is fireproof.
The wood seems to have been treated somehow, and is fireproof.
For heaven's sake, you're only looking for an out-of-date map. Murder does seem a little extreme.
The wall wriggles in discomfort to avoid further devastation.
Fire leaps out from the rod into the heart of the thorn wall, which screams out as it burns, revealing a great hole through the wild flames. You catch a tantalising glimpse of a great Temple, before the wall heals back. But it is unable to recover entirely, and a charred gap is left to the south. You could probably squeeze through it.
The melting point of this glass is very high, and amazingly it withstands the bolt of fire.^
(Perhaps predictably) the bomb explodes!
You start a great conflagration, and then perish in it!
A bolt of fire leaps from the rod and consumes 
 utterly!
This is rather dangerous, I'm afraid. Use only on vegetative matter.
Fire
Nothing obvious happens.
Although nothing seems to happen to you, the whole golden sphere gracefully contracts, pulling itself tight until it sits comfortably in the palm of your hand. You blink.^
You are engulfed in a cloud of spinning white lights, like insects. When the swarm clears, you find yourself transported...^
Well, that's not very useful, is it?  I'd go on strike if I were you.
Returning
The knight jumps on the spot (landing loudly).
A blooming shrub, gay with red flowers, is being nursed in a wide round tub under the wall here.
The shrub bursts into bloom, flowering all over in dozens of delicate red moons.
The marble jerks, as if straining to grow, but falls back dead.
The tree tried hard, but in the end it couldn't give a fig.
The tree strains especially hard, and manages to produce another fig, which ripens and falls... you jump forward and catch the fruit just before it would splatter to earth.
Your hair stands momentarily on end, as if it wants to stalk up out of your head, but happily it decides against.
The tree shakes and shivers, but thankfully remains intact.
Whoosh!^^The thorn wall grows another twenty feet high, then collapses in on itself, settling back like a beast. It is thicker and nastier than ever.
Nothing obvious happens.
^Warning: something extremely cliched is about to happen. When you think you have composed yourself and can stand it, press ENTER. 
Suddenly an enormous beanstalk sprouts out of the ground, exactly as per fairy tale, reac hing up high into the sky!  You yawn convulsively.
It has no horticultural application.
Stalking
Oh, the knight has been nearer the infinite than you could ever take him.
You acquire no especial sense of the infinite.
Nothing obvious happens.
You feel the air charge with excitement, and the symbol glows fiercely gold for a moment, but then the power drains away into one of the empty sockets in the arc.
Nothing happens this time.
The air charges with excitement, and the symbol glows fiercely gold, then begins to spin, faster and faster into a pearly golden light with bathes you with the flow of pure magic. 
But it is still too weak!  You half-hear, half-imagine a whisper of druids...
Everything becomes a daze and then you find yourself...^
Well, where might you have seen infinity before?
Infinity
You feel suddenly obedient, and briefly fancy a dog biscuit.
Alas, Austin is far, far too undomesticated. It has no effect.
Guided by some animal sixth sense, the squirrel gracefully jumps out of the way.
Nothing obvious happens.
The goats suddenly look up at you with awe, although they resume their former interest in eating the grass quite quickly.
Perhaps you should look up ~husbandry~ in a dictionary.
Husbandry
You acquire a sudden sun tan, but it soon fades.
Austin is already ginger, which is near enough.
He shrugs it off. (Isn't adamantine impressive enough for you?)
At once, the bronze polishes up to the shine of a mirror.
Nothing obvious happens.
Nothing further happens.
With an awful heaving, wrenching noise, the mural slides a little sideways, opening up a murky downward passage which can't have been used for centuries.
Bronze is the key here. Have you seen any other bronze anywhere?
Bronze
The goats mill around too much to aim at one accurately.
Still obedient to your intent, the goats part so that one stands alone. Using this Rod, you vapourise it instantaneously, and the rest contentedly return.^^Do you think there might be a moral to draw here about the use, and abuse, of power?
You don't really want to sacrifice Austin.
Would be a shame, after all that surgery.
You decide you can manage without 
, which you annihilate with the Rod.
The Black pieces make a rash break out of their defences, sacrificing a piece in vain and going down to a rapid defeat as a result.^^The White Queen rises from the board, an avenging angel's smile on her face, and swings a broadsword of burning light across your body...
A treasure in every sense, the orb pulsates with golden radiance.
The White pieces advance: first a bishop, then a knight is sacrificed, clearing away the wall of pawns which surround the Black king so that a dazzling checkmate can be executed!^^You fade out of the orb as oddly as you came, struck by the way it now almost pulsates in your palm.^
You feel a noble surge of pride as your body is incinerated by the Rod. At least you died for some terribly important cause, although exactly what it was seems to have slipped your mind.
Nothing obvious happens.
Far, far too dangerous. The age of martyrs in the church is long gone, you know.
Sacrifice
You feel no different. Perhaps there's no such thing as luck.
You feel optimistic and lucky. Mind you, you feel that most times.
Austin is already too lucky by half.
Reassembled after all these years... how lucky can you get?
The sailor shudders suddenly.
The die rattles a little, then settles.
Nothing obvious happens.
Well, if there's such a thing as luck, maybe this would help.
Luck
You feel a sudden chill.
For a fleeting moment, 
 freezes up.
It's already cold.
There is an enormous hissing of steam, creating wildly swirling mists, after whose parting an apparently cool rod is left behind.
Nothing obvious happens.
Use only at heated moments, when affairs are delicately balanced.

Nothing obvious happens. You curse eloquently in Celtic.
Nice idea. Now the kiosk-keeper also knows a smattering of Celtic. Unfortunately his national pride is too strong. You'll have to try something else - you have carte blanche to solve this problem.

The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

Perhaps you may one day earn a place in vol. III.
Modestly, the author (died 1940 or so?) missed himself out.
She's far too recent to be included.
Mad Isaac (1705-1792) went in for mystic experiments of all kinds, and was a noted antiquarian. He believed that the Meldrew family had an ancestral curse, dooming each member to undertake a futile quest. The only way to break the curse, he thought, was for one of them to actually succeed... unfortunately he died in peculiar circumstances before finding out how.^^Then again, he also believed that King Arthur's wizard Merlin was buried not in a Tintagel cave, as is usually claimed, but somewhere in the back garden (near where the motorway is now), and that the moon is a giant pair of black and white discs towed through the night sky by a team of angels.
It seems Ebenezer (1846-1908), the younger of a pair of twins, threw up a promising career in the East India Company one day, took a packet steamer to Cape Colony and simply marched off into the bush on a quest to find a legendary river. His maps were used for several years after, and a province was named after him for a while, but the locals call it something else now.
Roger (1846-1913), the elder of a pair of twins, was very Victorian indeed, especially in his disapproval of his beautiful young wife's literary career. He thought her romances so immoral that he refused to allow the family name to appear on them. A prominent local vestryman, his own writing was confined to a great many monographs on the problems of municipal drainage, but he died before his grand National Sewerage Plan was complete.
~Capability~ Meldrew (1761-1817) became a mildly celebrated landscape gardener, starting a brief fashion for crypts and memorials as garden ornaments (he claimed it was closer to nature). Very little of his work now survives. His real name, incidentally, was Willard.
Very little is known about Henri, who lived at some time in the fifteenth century. As a young man he fought at Agincourt, and seems to have been some kind of combat engineer. The story goes that he acquired his nickname, The Black Post, from a joke made by the King when he was standing up to his waist in a ditch. He must have been proud of it because his coat of arms bears his name written down the left hand side, and Black Post down the right.^^In his later years he became morbidly possessed, and (according to legend) spent his declining years working on his own tomb, which he insisted would be of celestial importance.
Helene Meldrew (1902-) is a noted painter and sculptress. Her relations with the family were broken off in the 20s when she married Anton and ran off to Paris to study art, but she has recently returned to the House, in search (as she puts it) of ~the perfect blue, the blue of the sky, the blue of water~. We wish her well.
Anton Smyslov shouldn't really be in the book, even if he did marry Helene, but there is a brief passage, since he was so famous - he was a chess grandmaster, and won the Paris Open five years running in the 1930s. His speciality was bold sacrificial attacks, but he was also notorious for eating blueberry yoghurt at the board.
Under the pseudonym Marie Swelldon, your ancestress Alison (1871-1930) wrote several mildly successful romances. She obsessively collected lucky charms, and advertised in newspapers for double-headed coins and the like (although she never traced a rumoured find of a five-leafed clover, somewhere in County Donegal).^^In order to write in tranquillity and to avoid her husband, it was she who installed the fake wall at the far south end of the attic east wing, and each afternoon she would sneak upstairs to push it aside.
Oh dear, the deeply regrettable Sir Joshua Meldrewe (1710-1776). Member of the Dilletanti Society and the Hell-Fire Club, and a politician (chancellor of the exchequer 1762-3; ~probably the least competent minister ever to hold that office~ - Oxford History of England, vol. xii).^^
His father disinherited him for wildly excessive living (he almost invariably wore jewelled buttons worth at least a thousand pounds) and for marrying a lady of easy virtue while on the run from a prison in France, where he was sentenced to be beheaded. In order to stop his sister getting the fortune, he went back to Italy and advertised for a pregnant bride to provide a male heir. This nefarious plot was foiled when he choked to death on a chicken-bone.^^It is said that he stole the money anyway near the end, and certainly some gold went missing. (He also managed to get the family stripped of its baronetcy by cheating at piquet with the Prince of Wales.)
Your distant great-uncle Hartley was a tiresomely enthusiastic amateur Egyptologist who, every Christmas, used to sit you on his knee and drone on about trenches and writings and the fellaheen. It was all a bit of a fraud, you now discover, since he only actually went to Egypt once - there was such a scandal about his refusal to donate his best find to the British Museum that he was never allowed to excavate again, though he spent years writing in vain to the Egyptian government.
Roger's eldest son Gerard (1898-1916) was killed in the Battle of the Somme. His mother, ~Marie Swelldon~, gave up writing afterwards.
Austin's quite venerable for a cat, but not that old.
Tobias Meldrew (1801-1870) was Professor of Theology at Christminster, 1850-66. He set himself the task of proving the existence of God from first principles, a task which he announced in 1860 that he had accomplished with the aid of ten thousand intermediate lemmas. The derision which greeted his attempts to publish the mammoth work eventually drove him insane, and he spent the last four years of his life in the madhouse.
Annoyingly there's no index (there was going to be a consolidated one in vol. I) and you can't find what you want.
It was to have been the Honourable Peter Meldrew's life's work, a two-volume edition giving the definitive family history. Unfortunately, although he claimed to have hunted for evidence to the ends of the earth, he never could find a detail he wanted for volume I, and it was never published. Somehow, this typifies your family, and consulting this worthy book about your ancestors makes you realise what an uncanny knack they had for never quite achieving anything.^^Unless, of course, you count having an awful lot of children. So many Meldrews are listed here that you'll have to look them up individually.

You have succeeded in shaking off the Curse of the Meldrews: for the first time in sixty generations, a Meldrew has found the useless object he was doomed to seek!  Unfortunately on the way to the airport you realise that you left the map on the kitchen table in all the rush, but never mind, you're on holiday now.
Yes, probably just as well to give up looking, and heaven knows there's enough packing to do, what with the rest of the family in uproar. Oh well.

Racked with guilt over your bad language, you are unable to nod off.
Austin leaps up onto the bed, jumps around for a bit, and then falls back onto the floor. You are unable to get any sleep.
You doze awhile, but that's all.
You sleep unexpectedly deeply, but just as you think you are starting to wake up, you experience a sudden...^
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.^^A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

It isn't at all clear on what principle the detector works. It looks like a smoke detector, certainly. But you just left the contractors to sort out all those boring fire prevention matters for themselves.^^They were a slap-dash firm, too, from what you remember. They put the little white thing high up, right in the middle of the Capricorn scene on the mural. And even if there was a fire, chances are it would be useless.

Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.
From here, you can only squeeze back east to the observatory.

You take Mad Isaac down.
Taken. (There's a fireplace behind it, by the way.)
A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall.
It used to hang in the downstairs landing, and the red, deranged eyes annoyed everybody who passed. Then Aunt Jemima picked up the ridiculous idea that it was by Sir Joshua Reynolds and had it valued. Happily it wasn't and, to cut a long story long, it ended up here.
Carry this with you everywhere you go.

This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.
William Wordsworth once described poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity. If so, hospitals must be full of people turning out verses about what it was like to fall off the roof of a high building. Perhaps it might be better not to join them.
Roof
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.^^It is peculiarly cold here.
The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction.
Battlements
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.
This chimney must have been the one the gothic-looking iron key fell down, for here it is.

Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was.

He didn't seem to be experimenting in those days.
In 1792, the last year of his life, ol' red-eyes becomes very excited about his new discovery. This time he claims that Merlyn bounde uppe the mystic estate (by this he means the back garden - Isaac never did have any sense of proportion) wyth great Roddes of Power. These are dangerous, yet also useful in themselves, but are really part of a great key... the usual nonsense. Of course you never actually see these rods, because they disguise themselves until waved by someone wearing Merlyn's hat.^^The funny thing is that Isaac died (legend has it, by spontaneous combustion) only a week after this breakthrough, preventing him from sending yet another paper to the Royal Society. But since Merlyn supposedly lived in about the sixth century A.D., there can't be a lot left of his hat, so the matter may be academic.

This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.^^An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you.

Aunt Jemima has never done what you suggested at the best of times. This is not the best of times.
Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.
She's been fiddling about with those cut flowers all afternoon. And she's a bit upset at being left alone in the house while you're off on holiday, so best not to get on her bad side. You really ought to make it up to her somehow.

The wine cellars are now quite badly stocked, many of the hexagonal racks being home only to woodlice now. Much of what there is was laid in by your father and has corked

This is the eastern end of the cellars, from which you can only go west.
Wine Cellars
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.
Cellars South
Nothing is to be gained by this.
There's nothing within reach inside.
The mouse runs back out of the hole, looking dustier but none the worse for its adventure

From somewhere inside the hole, you hear a disconsolate bleep.
From somewhere inside the hole, you hear the spinning of tiny wheels, followed by an excitable high-pitched beep and a dull clanging noise.

Lying where the mouse dropped it is a small brass-coloured key.
Brass is of course a non-magnetic copper-zinc alloy, so presumably this key also contains iron.
It isn't the attic key, I fear.

The west end of a disused and shadowy old cellar. It was bricked up when you were a child - you never did find out why. Perhaps the golden, jewelled staircase leading down into smoky mists to the south might be something to do with it.

You bark your knuckles painfully on the iron, and to no avail.
In the northwest wall is a heavy, imposing ironbound door.

A flight of sandstone steps, cut in the 1920s when an Egyptological craze was sweeping England, slants down from the coal-dust passage to the east.

A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum.

Leaned against one of the eight corners is a ragged white parchment scroll.
A lamentably naff tourist's gift, this seems to be a ~replica~ of one of the papyri on which some lost Greek play or other was written. Some nonsense about the priestess of Apollo being summoned by music, etcetera.^^It has all the charm of a tea-towel of, oh, say the Taj Mahal made out of curry.

In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

You can't go that way.^^Now, this takes a little explaining... These days, it isn't easy to keep up a house the size of Meldrew Hall, and your family has had to strike a bargain with the National Trust that the house should be open to the public in the summer months. The maze is so popular with visitors that the grass has worn away, and it's being reseeded at the moment, so you shouldn't go treading all over it.
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading ~To the Mosaic~ points east across the lawn.
Family Tree
plane tree
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house.
The options appear to be east or west.
Lawn Ornaments
Prominent amongst these is a plaster statuette, a bust of a woman.
It stands four feet high. At the base is an engraving: ~Self-Portrait, H.M. '54~. (It's presumably not by Her Majesty the Queen, though.)
plaster statuette
It plummets down into the well.
The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.
You can make out nothing below, and the well is too small to climb down.
ancient well
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.
From here you can climb back up to the lawn.
Mosaic
Made of terra-cotta and ceramic fragments, it has held together surprisingly well.

A hard wooden ball, palm-sized, rolls about across the mosaic.

A magnificent view of the gardens would be yours, were it not for the branches and leaves which surround you. You can make out Aunt Jemima up at one of the conservatory windows, but hide from her view. Down below, the privet-hedge layout of the maze can be seen through the lower branches.
No, don't go out on a limb.

You're strolling on a pleasant bricked path, passing from the outer rooms of Meldrew Hall to a track through the eastern side of the garden.
Bricked Path
Your first step towards the sparrows startles them into the air, and they whirl upwards and around with panic, chirping their alarm.^
Named by some family wag generations back, this is a restful hedge garden, crowned with a summer house to the north, widening out to a broad croquet lawn east.
Hedgery
A flock of sparrows crowds around the gutters of the summer house. Every now and then one flits up and lands somewhere else, and they bustle about chirpily.

One of the most beautiful hedge-enclosed, tree-muffled lawns in England, and just out of sight of the house, this has been a jewel in the gardens for centuries. Since the twenties it has also been a croquet lawn, of the regulation twenty-four yards square, laid out with a central coloured peg and six peripheral hoops

The lawn is enclosed on all sides, but for a gap back west.

It is in one piece.
You catch a fascinating, but all too brief, glimpse of something grey, angular and tall... which slips out of view as your unsteady hand shakes.
Through the golden eyepiece you see, not the moon (for the astrolabe is tilted too low), but a curious, sunlit, grey triangle.^^Fascinated, you strain closer to the vision... closer...^

For the sake of the grass, you can't go that way.
This flagstoned rampart on the hillside looks across the valley, down (unfortunately) to the motorway below. Coaches pass by, reminding you of the rapidly approaching time when visitors will have to be let in again for the summer. The only safe way to go is back east into the maze. To one side is a plaque.
The hillside is too steep.
Viewpoint Ledge
~This viewpoint, one of the finest in the county, was laid down by Capability Meldrew, a well-known landscape gardener of his day. It was intended as one of the rewards of the garden maze, and was constructed c. 1808 after an earlier folly on the site collapsed.~

A miniature plastic etching rests on the plaque.
No larger than a playing card, it depicts the Folly which used to stand on the hillside outcrop.
What's the point of a drawing so small it might almost be a playing card?

Labourers toil in the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.^^Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe.

You pass uncomfortably straight through the hide wall.^
It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.
Premonition
You pass uncomfortably back through the hide wall.^
This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent.
The General's Tent
This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs.
Shrine of the Bear
Your mouth is too furred up to speak.

Now that really would not be very kind.
The Druid catches sight of your ghostly hand taking the mascot, and immediately begins her occultations, cursing you and your ill-gotten gains. But she is unable to make contact with you, and turns furiously to the tapestry, hissing ~lagach~ to the Bear. At once a sudden swirl of wind seems to pull her into the rough cloth, dissolving her to nothing.
On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind.
The mascot is in the shape of an ankh, with a lemniscus (or infinity) symbol moulded onto it.
^In an astonishing freak accident, 
a meteorite hurtles through the Earth's atmosphere and then straight through your head. Anyone would think you had a curse on you (anyone, that is, still able to think).

a long-dormant volcano erupts instantaneously below your feet. Anyone would think you had a curse on you (anyone, that is, still standing).
lightning abruptly strikes into your body, making your hair stand on end. (Oh, and vapourising you utterly, of course.)
four hundred Spartan soldiers are transported by some quantum-mechanical fluke from the Battle of Thermopylae into your immediate vicinity. They are quite keen for someone to explain things to them, but unfortunately most of the spears they were throwing came with them; one of which struck straight through the mascot into your body.
^You feel very nervous indeed, for some reason.
^You stub your toe painfully, and trip over.
^You feel bed-sores coming on.

^Something feels very wrong indeed. Your hand begins to burn.^
An absolute essential.

This is one of those dreams where you find you cannot speak.
Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too walks in this strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect.
Druid
You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it.
Camp Fire
^You awaken, shivering with dread.
A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out...
Near Dolmen
A strangely familiar, dusty passage, sloping down from a southern end bathed in hostile light to some kind of metal barrier in the north.
^A ghostly apparition of a venerable man hazes into view. He raises his mahogany staff and strikes it (silently) on the ground, then points it at the walls, and suddenly a flurry of green luminescence chases around you!^^He fades away again, mumbling something incoherent.
Melancholy Dream
The metal barrier is indistinct, on the edge of your consciousness, and you can't get close. However familiar it seems.

You bat at the flurries with your hand, but they're just green light (with the tiniest mosquito-sting).

Your ghostly self is embedded in a diagonal downward shaft (descending to the east) entirely filled with dry sand. Solid flagstones line the walls.

Flaming torches bracketed in the wall gutter as the last oxygen in the air is consumed, and the flicker of flame plays across the yellow-orange glaze of the tomb walls.^^This octagonal chamber is lined with Egyptian hieroglyphics.

This shambolic flat, extending to the east, shares a filthy hallway with the one upstairs. To the south, passers-by pass by along the street. Peeling-away posters have been stuck up on top of each other on the walls, in such a way that you can only read the most recent.
Shadowy Hallway
You hastily tear down the poster, but there's nothing interesting behind it, only painted graffiti: ~Shantih Shantih Shantih~.
You wave the poster at the boat, but the boat remains unmoved.^
~Bateaux Phlebas - toujours le dernier mot~. You briefly wish you had a dog called Toto, so as to be able to say ~Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in England any more.~
What a very useful piece of paper. Pity there's writing on it.

Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and stylish despite the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel, caked with paint, littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't help standing on tiptoe here.

You feel briefly incensed.
Peculiarly, the hanging curtain seems to be solid iron when you walk into it.
The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric bell push and a wicked Tarot pack.
Consulting Room
That's funny. For a moment there your hand seemed to go straight through the pack of cards without touching it!
An intriguing idea, but you'll have to be more explicit about how to do it.
Madame Sosostris won't let you.
That would look rather incongruous, surely?
You carefully lay 
 face down on the tarot pack.
The cards defy mortal examination.

Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in concentration as 
, 
 and then 
 show. 
She blanches with alarm, then recovers and jabbers something about not taking the cards too literally, the images being symbolic and so on. As rapidly as she possibly can, she warns you to fear death by water and then hustles you out onto the street.^
~You have come!  At last, after all these centuries!  But there is little I can do to ease your way, save to return the staff you left with me for safe keeping.~  And she shows you out. You feel rather bewildered.^
~Curse it, another nobody,~ she hisses in an unguarded moment, as she tidies the pack absentmindedly with her hands. Then she recovers her poise and advises about handsome strangers, fearing death by water, crossing palms with gold and so on. Eventually she ushers you out.^
Madame Sosostris looks at you in some irritation.
Madame Sosostris, the famous clairvoyante, breezes in through the hanging curtain and sits behind the table, making waving gestures with her hands.^^~First, this I must know, were you born in an even, or an odd, year?~
She has helped enough.
Madame Sosostris breezes in once more. ~You again,~ she says warily. ~Let us see how your fortunes have changed.~^^

Gratefully she blows her nose but then returns the handkerchief. You refold it ingeniously.
She looks warily at

She kisses you forcibly. Her mouth tastes of tobacco.
She mesmerises you into immobility. She hasn't lived all these centuries in the Latin Quarter for nothing, you know.
She is startled and stares.

She has a bad cold, but nevertheless is known to be the wisest woman in Europe.

Shoddy workmanship, but never mind, it's only a staff and who needs those any more?

That foul water?  Not a chance.
Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.
Down by River
You wave the handkerchief, and the boat glides smoothly across the river toward you.
On one especially repellent mound is, of all things, a fine silk handkerchief.
Monogrammed J. A. P., but that's no great matter.
People had no style in those days, before they invented paper tissues. I mean this tatty cloth is hardly attractive, is it?
silk handkerchief
Are you in Seine?  There is a river in between you and the boat.
On the far bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat. As much as you like to explore, you can't see how to attract its attention.
Moored close to the bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat.
The side reads: PHLEBAS.
tourist boat
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east. At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to windward.
On board the Phlebas
You are unable to touch the man. It is as if he isn't there.
Your question merely echoes inside him.
You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the boat again, and you find yourself:^
^Was any of that real? you wonder, as you relax in the sunshine. But then you realise you are clutching a tarot card which certainly is.
~I don't believe in that place any more. Hurry up please it's time!~
~Hurry up please it's time!~
~HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME!~
He can't be bothered to say anything this time.
It really is time you thought of something.
Time and time again you haven't guessed correctly.
The hollow man must be beginning to think you can't take a hint.
~It's time!~ repeats the hollow man.
The hollow man mechanically says: ~Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time.~
Every now and then he whimpers.

^A clock keeps the hours, with a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
^There is a brown fog about, like a winter dawn's.
^You can almost make out the pleasant whining of a mandoline from a faraway bar.
^Drifting through the streets from some distant bar comes the sound of one of Scott Joplin's newfangled piano pieces, accompanying song settings from ~Romeo and Juliet~.
A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so full of black-suited pedestrians off to work at banks that you can't force your way any further east. Once in a while a few of the bowler-hatted army step into the street and down some steps below a Metropolitan sign.
You can't force your way through the tide of bankers.
Near Ring Road
~Q'est-ce que vous voulez acheter?~
This is a vast underground station in great rectangular caverns, deep beneath the streets. You are outside the ticket gates, near a flight of steps back up to the city, and since you haven't a ticket you're likely to stay that way.
Back up the stairs for you. Call yourself a traveller...
Chatelet-les-Halles
~Ceci n'est pas argent,~ he explains wearily.
He takes the money. ~Q'est-ce que vous desirez?~
It's not that he doesn't understand you, he's just obstructive for the sake of it.
Extremely reluctantly he serves you, giving you a tourist map of Paris.
He refuses to understand you, on principle.
~Non.~  And he folds his arms defiantly. Perhaps he has no such thing.
Behind a kiosk, a surly-looking man is selling guide books and maps.
His jumper is unstriped, and there are no onions around his neck. Nonetheless he has a rather Gallic, disgruntled look to him. Perhaps he's a former Socialist cabinet minister.

Just the way you remember yours having been.
Burn it!  Burn it at once!
What a very useful map!  Now you can go on holiday.

DERoom
You pass between the steel walls and a light passes over you. Now you know how paper feels in a photocopier
.^
 - in this case, one which jams. Steel barriers appear across the corridor, and you are obliged to withdraw back to the foyer.^^After a moment, the barriers recede again.
The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.^^The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor.
There's no apparent way but south.
Museum Foyer
You give the revolving door a heave, and it begins to move; but you pause, out of breath, after only a half turn. 
Interestingly, there's something inside this segment of it.
Why not go northeast and look inside?

A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see.
One of those pretentious exhibition posters. Your German is just about adequate to the task:^^~Cults of the Druids - a Major Retrospective, October-November 1988~.

The beach ball, a welcome dash of colour in this drab monochrome night, is simply too big, cumbersome and round to get hold of.
You pass between the steel walls and a light passes over you. Suddenly barriers spring out across the corridor, thumping into the beach ball which rapidly begins to deflate.^^There is a sharp hiss as you nimbly jump over the ball, and then a horrid clang as the barriers come together behind you.^
You bounce the beach ball along in front of you.
A colourful, striped inflated beach ball bounces around.

A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are high, but there's just enough light to see by.
Hall of Exhibits
Only cards will fit.
Resting on a little display table is a Tarot box.
There's nothing worthwhile in it.

A single bright light in the darkness.

Andromeda chained to a rock on the sea-shore.

A long painted still life graces one wall near a corner.
A disturbing painting, perhaps by Edvard Munch, this is a still life of a seedling on a table, surrounded by a rusty iron rod with a star on the end, a glass bottle, a lamp and a bunch of keys. No doubt these arcane objects held some special significance for primitive tribes now absorbed into civilisation.
still life
It sounds like a thinly, but enthusiastically, attended football match. There are ragged German chants but only the word ~Eumenides~ pokes out.
You step downward in some confusion, but your senses are assailed by some kind of vision, of a ghastly circle of druids watching your every move and plotting, plotting...^^In horror you turn back.
A dark staircase, turning from east to south as it descends. The hideous sound of arhythmic chanting can be heard from below.
Dark Staircase
On one step, an empty matchbook lies discarded.
It's from the Ruined Castle Cafe, and (like the Cafe) is matchless.
Ah, I fear it is only a token clue.

It shows a great many crystal-glass cups and glasses.

No, this is a goat. A ~ram~ is a kind of sheep.
You seem to lack the will any more. The drug must have taken hold.
An old administrative office of the museum, emptied and made into a prison cell: amateur but effective.
There's definitely no way out of here.
^A key turns in the door and Doktor Stein bursts in. He stops to pat the goat affectionately. ~Cheer up, Dobbin. As soon as I've finished this brutal human sacrifice I'll take you for your walk.~ He feeds Dobbin some sugar-cake. ~They make such marvellous cheese,~ he explains confidentially.^
^In a trance, you go willingly to your (somewhat messy) sacrifice...
^Kicking and screaming, you are are dragged off to a grisly sacrifice...
Coven Cell
The goat happily munches down

The medicine bottle cracks open in the goat's jaws!
For heaven's sake, the daisy chain is far too useful for that.
In a harsh voice, the goat intones:^^

Just a crook. And what's wrong with crooks, that's what I say.

They're coming as fast as they can!  Ritual doesn't just happen by itself, you know.

cell door
It's too dark to see much inside the cabinet.
An annexe to the museum, containing sundry archaelogical finds, badly labelled in German (which you can hardly read at the best of times) and securely pinioned inside glass cabinets. The storm outside thrashes against the narrow dark windows.
Cabinet Room
Just how broken do you want it to be?
You smash the glass... noisily. Still, the cabinet is open now.
One cabinet looks particularly vulnerable.
You could just look inside the broken glass cabinet.
^Finally reacting to the alarm you set off, Doktor Stein appears and steps toward you, clapping his hands sharply. And dozens of robed figures leap out of the darkness - but these are no security guards. Their faces are painted hideously and they betray no emotion as they pinion you tight...^^~So, Meldrew. It is all as it was prophesied,~ says Stein in a perfectly conversational tone as he forces your mouth open and makes you swallow a violet pill.^^~One of your apothecary ancestors made this drug!  Appropriate, no?~^^
You feel queasy, but this is perhaps the least of your problems as they drag you off...^^
glass cabinet
Reach down the grating as you may, it remains just beyond reach.
A smooth palm-sized disc, perhaps of pumice stone, painted in yellows and browns with a single star motif, around which (clockwise) are the words ~nog~, ~er~, ~ska~ and ~iw~. If you remember the label rightly, something funny has been done to a piece of metal embedded in the top, but your German wasn't up to understanding what.
Doesn't the shape strike you as familiar at all?  - There, that should point you in the right direction.

^Over in one corner, you can see a little square window, behind which must be the store of cups and glasses. Remembering this, you are distracted and unable to enjoy the entertainment. Even the table is annoying. It must have one leg shorter than the rest, or something, because it rattles now and then.
You look rather conspicuous striking the rod on the cafe table, but everyone else assumes you're part of the cabaret. Anyway, the rod charges up as usual.
This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to the ruined castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very slight.
The crowd is lively and exciting, but also inconsiderate and bulky.
^The table rattles again.^
Ruined Castle Cafe
Now don't panic, but there's a ticking bomb loosely taped to the underside of the table you're sitting at!
You make no further alarming discoveries.
Even in a cafe as lively as this, your natural English inhibitions make it impossible for you to climb up on the table.
cafe table
Suddenly, someone catches sight of you with the bomb and screams. One thing leads to another, and, well, you know how it is with foreign legal systems. At least the bomb gets defused, and twenty-five years isn't all that long.
Taped loosely to the underside of the table is a complicated-looking bomb.
It contains a timer-detonator, a bundle of plastic explosives and many, many wires. The most obvious ones are green, red, blue and black. They would pull out of their loose sockets in the timer easily, so perhaps this bomb disposal nonsense isn't as tricky as people make out.
^Click!  Perhaps there's more to bomb disposal than you thought.^
^Click!  The timer runs out, but the bomb was disarmed. You pocket the timer and hide the rest of the evidence under the table.^
^In a sudden cataclysm, there is an enormous explosion from your table, blowing out all the arrowslit windows, making a thunderous noise, starting a minor fire, and of course having one other consequence:^
complicated-looking bomb
The timer seems quite simple to set. 
The clock is running, and currently at 
 minutes.
At present the clock is reset to zero.
It is already running!
You wind back the timer to ten minutes, and off it goes.
^You hear a sharp click!^
But the flash does nothing.
And the flash gives a pathetically small flash of light.
The flash suddenly gives an enormous magnesium-flare flash, almost blinding in its intensity. Your eyes take a little while to adjust. 
Consequently you can only hear as the cabaret audience gives you a round of applause for what they think is a magic trick.
Consequently you can only hear as the smudge on the horizon rises from the waves, becomes an enormous Kraken sea monster and lunges for the stone tower. (Considering this is supposed to be a Greek myth it feels surprisingly like a Japanese 1960s creature film.) The Kraken swipes at you, overreaches itself and falls over forward, impaling itself extremely messily on the pharos. Your eyes just about recover by the time the rest of your body is crushed by its weight.^^Up on Mount Olympus, Zeus is still cross. ~Take me to your Leda~, you wittily demand, but this does not seem to improve matters. Poseidon also looks rather fed up, but luckily a sizeable faction of goddesses takes your side and arranges to have you resurrected...^

This basement room is filled with crate after crate of glasses and cups, enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost anything might be hidden among them. A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is shut tight.
There's no apparent way out of here.
^There is a scuffling noise as some people gather up on the pavement outside the skylight.
^The men begin to talk like conspirators, but half in chants. You catch occasional sounds, but can make little sense of them.
^Alarmingly, you catch the odd word ~incendiary~ and are almost sure you can make out someone say ~accursed Meldrew~ (in the old-fashioned way, you know, so that ~accursed~ rhymes with ~dead~). Paranoia, bound to be. There surely can't really be a conspiracy of druid-worshippers out to get you?
^~The prophecy must be fulfilled!~ one warns, in an unearthly voice which suddenly carries. The others hush him.
^The men walk away, perhaps a few feet, perhaps a mile.
Cups and Glasses
Through the square window in the door you can see a bar at which staff are serving, and a very crowded and lively cafe-restaurant beyond. The cabaret act has her back to you, and a considerable amount of her front to the diners.

Nothing else.
In fact there's nothing hidden among the crates but a model sailing ship. You pick it up from force of habit.
numerous
cups and glasses
An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates.
Old, unwanted, dusty, empty.
The model ship is, of course, far too large to fit into the bottle.
It won't fit.
The bundle of sticks will just fit through the bottle's neck. With a sudden spring, just as the last of the stick passes the neck, its masts fold out... and you have put the ship into the bottle.
The great challenge, of course, is to get a ship inside.
mounted bottle
You can't get a good look from here.
You admire the fine detail on the model sailing ship, and feel strangely drawn to it. But back out of the world of the Tarot box, nothing else could happen.
Bright sunshine glints off the glass bottle, making it impossible to see detail within.
You look very closely at the fine detail on the model sailing ship. Perhaps it's the distorting glass of the bottle, perhaps your romantic imagination, but the deck seems more detailed, the rigging might almost be swaying, the little figure by one mast might almost be alive...^^In fact, the closer you look the more sea-sick you feel.^^Thank heavens for the deck rail, something to hang on to while this moment of queasiness passes.
Within the whisky bottle is a model sailing ship, far too large to have passed the neck.
Oh, well done!  Why not take a closer look, you deserve it?
ship in a bottle
A superb model sailing ship, about six inches from prow to stern, immaculate in every detail from an anchor on a filigree chain to a carved mermaid up front.
As you pull the anchor chain, the masts fold inwards and the decks concertina back, until you're holding no more than a tight bundle of sticks.
The great challenge, of course, is to get it inside a bottle.

Ever the optimist.
As you pull the anchor chain, the sticks spring back outwards into the fully-rigged model sailing ship you knew of old.
A tightly-folded bundle of sticks, about six inches long, with a filigree chain and anchor hanging from it.
The great challenge, of course, is to get it inside a bottle.

Salt water!  No thanks.
Mmm. Here is your first and only warning: the sea is the domain of Poseidon, and he's not what you'd call a gentleman.
As you dive into the sea, you catch sight of Andromeda looking suddenly cheerful. It soon becomes apparent why, as a Kraken wakes from the depths of the ocean and swipes you for a quick snack. You seem to have replaced her as sacrifice... a Pyrrhic victory which even the prospect of stellification does little to assuage.
A rough rocky sea shore below barely-climbable cliffs, against which inviting deep blue sea laps. It seems to be early morning, soon after dawn, from the look of the sun on the water.^
^You can just make out the Pharos atop the cliffs. But it seems to be earlier, nearer dawn, than your last visit.
The rocks are too dangerous. You'll have to scale the cliff.
Sea Shore
She evades you deftly, having had years of practice with Greek men.
No need, if the sea-monster is all it's cracked up to be.
She smiles as if to say there's not much point watching her waist-line any more, and hungrily wolfs down her favourite dessert. As a gesture of thanks, she takes off her amber hairband and hands it you. Quickly she readopts her noble pose, however, just in case anyone else is looking.
She looks with obvious hunger, but her sense of duty wins out and she refuses.
She looks down her nose at you.
Andromeda hisses something contemptuous at you in Greek. (Attic, not Demotic, ironically enough, but then it's all Greek to you.)
Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea as she awaits her fate.
Avert your eyes. She is naked
 (unless you count a hairband)
, as was fashionable for human sacrifices: the victim left overnight without food or shelter until the dawn. It has to be said that she doesn't look all that keen to be rescued
.
.^^Of course you've already rescued her, in a sense, but that's not due to happen for an hour or two yet by her time, so you can hardly expect thanks. Gives you a nice warm feeling inside, all the same.
Andromeda
A long clasp of amber, perfect for long straggly Greek hair.

On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous slither down leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even more hazardous. Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle lighthouse, but there is no way in from here.^^A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth.
There's only dull grassland that way.
Cliffs
The goats hiss and butt against you, not letting you through.
The goats obediently part to allow you to get by.^
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats, continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.
There's only dull grassland that way.

Grunt!

A long walk along the cliffs from the lighthouse leads naturally here, just outside the Eraina Taverna, whose open doorway lies to the south.
There's only dull grassland that way.
Outside Taverna
The thorns deter you.
Only a small, thorny, unclimbable fig tree.
small thorny tree
Hanging from a low branch of a fig tree is, as you might expect, a fig.
Legend has it that the Roman emperor Augustus was killed by his wife Livia, who painted the figs on his tree with poison. Actually it looks like a perfectly nice piece of fruit.
You can ask a god for a date, but they just don't give a fig.
Good enough for a god.

Given the language difficulty, you'd better resort to barter.
A plain but cheery taverna, fill of miserable and rather ashamed men who are drinking retsina heavily. The day is dawning outside the north door, but they strangely do not share your uplifted feeling at the sight.
The tavern entrance is to the north.
^The diners grumble and play backgammon viciously.
^The bartender gives you a hard stare.
^A fight breaks out, over an obscure question to do with somebody's second cousin.
^The gentle sound of bazouki music strikes up in the background, gradually rising to an intolerable pitch. After a moment comes a dull thud and a strangled noise, then blessed quiet.
Eraina Taverna
You can't understand a word of what the bartender says, but the drift is clear enough. Not until you pay for it.
Left untouched on one table is an Ekmek Special dessert.
A speciality dessert of the Taverna: ice cream, kateifi, raspberry sauce, cream. An acquired taste.
Better with chocolate ice cream, I think.
Doesn't somebody else need this more than you?
Ekmek Special
The bartender takes the coin wearily, with a ~how can you eat at a time like this?~ look.
The bartender looks at 
 with a glazed expression.
Being an educated person, the bartender speaks a little Latin and some Aramaic. Being an uneducated one, you don't, and communication proves impossible.
Here, surrounded by all his cronies?
Behind the bar, a depressed bartender polishes glasses.
Morose and unconvivial at the best of times. This is not the best of times.

The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.
There's only dull grassland that way.
Wall of Thorns
The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive.
A ragged gap in the wall has been burnt out to the south.
It's hard to imagine what could possibly shift a wall like that.
wall of thorns
Zeus, chief of all the gods, appears and hurls a thunderbolt down just before you begin to cross into the Temple. 
With the kind of calculation only a god could make, Zeus has worked out exactly what would happen and aimed the thunderbolt so that it hits you straight in the back despite your attempt to weave about. Pretty impressive prediction, is your last thought.
Astonishingly, you beat the luck of the gods and slip into the temple just clear of the thunderbolt. ~Damn, missed!~ says a sepulchral voice from without.^
With the luck of the gods, Zeus' thunderbolt strikes you just about exactly in the back, despite your attempts to weave about.
Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred earth into the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that sort of thing.
The wall of thorns hems you in.
Sacred Earth
~I'll get you this time, worm!~ bellows Zeus, and hurls another thunderbolt, but now he's angry his aim is right off. You survive once more.^
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.^^Cloisters lead southeast and southwest, deeper into the temple.

Homer is asleep again, his syrinx tight in his arms.
~Hopeless,~ he says dismissively and falls asleep.
Homer is far too busy composing Book XIV of the Iliad.
Homer is asleep.^
Homer is awake already.
Homer sits half-awake, clutching his syrinx.
Homer wakes up, with a start. ~I suppose you want the syrinx,~ he grumbles, ~they always do. There are three questions you must answer wisely. The usual deal.~^^(He seems to be under an enchantment and able to speak modern English, or at least American.)^^~First: who is the brother of Menelaus?~
What, strike the greatest poet who ever lived?
Homer is asleep.
Homer glares back.
~Mph,~ he says (untranslatably). ~But can ya see the future?  Who's gonna rule Alexandria after the fall of the guy they're gonna call Alexander the Big?~
~What's your favorite color?~
Homer glares at you through sightless eyes.
Homer reluctantly hands you the syrinx. ~Now leave me alone, I got six books of the Iliad left to compose.~
The blind poet Homer half-slumbers here, clutching his syrinx (or Pan-pipes) to himself.
Homer is wearing a Columbo-style raincoat.

Now ask!~^^Apollo, as he vanishes, laughs in that style more recently popularised by Third World dictators and mad scientists. His priestess, the Oracle, steps out of the shadows.^

Lying on top of crushed, broken bones, in plain view, is a gleaming gem of amber.
Embedded within is the body of a fly. Scratched upon one face is the word ~GALITA~.
Isn't there some classical legend about her?

Perhaps the gods no longer inhabit such places. Your offering burns to nothing, for nothing.
The god Apollo moves in mysterious ways, for another fig has appeared on the tree.
You have pleased the god Apollo - Loxias, god of words and counsel, as he was once called! Very wise.
The god Apollo is unimpressed with your offering, which feeds the eternal flame.
You have no desire to be burnt.
In the centre of the cave rests an obsidian altar stone with a flaming bronze urn.
The altar stone, sometimes called ~Omphalos~ or ~the navel~, bears an odd cross or plus sign and is fabled to mark the centre of the world.^^Around the side of the urn are reliefs of feasts, of oxen being tracked and sacrificed, of the gathering of fruit and the making of cheese.

The priestess has told you enough.
The priestess remains silent. Only by an offering can the wisdom of Apollo be gained.
The priestess, Pythian oracle of Loxias, seems hardly to hear or understand: but goes into a trance, swaying to a sensuous rhythm: and chants, in English,^^
 ~As Hephaestus, master of the metals^  uncovered the gilden sunrise of Helicon^  so, in 
 and 
^  when six arches have stood sixty years^  shall even a shade's remains be cast.~
 ~Like the eruptions of Sicilian mounts^  shall come devices to ruin a castle,^  which no bronze armour can withstand^  save, it may be, a veil of the neck.~
 ~Your ancestor, pestle in hand^  made the salve you shall need^  to defy the Druids' earthly band:^  take care, mortal, take heed.~
^Apollo is what you might call an annoying git, were he not also an alarmingly powerful deity.
As you ought to know, the Oracle is inviolable.
The Oracle, the masked priestess of Apollo, stands here behind an obsidian altar-stone, three cubits cubed: to her side is a bronze urn, mouthing perpetual flame.

(Out of the corner of your eye, you notice the flash fall out of the device.)^
You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse. Considerately enough, the builders have provided a spiral staircase down. 
The cliffs below are familiar, but it's a little later in the day than your arrival on the sea shore. 
Much traffic plies across the bay, and trade seems to be picking up again now that the Kraken has gone.
There seems to be very little traffic at the moment, though a smudge on the horizon might possibly be a quinquireme.
^^In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay. 
The Mediterranean sparkles in the hot afternoon sun.
The sun is rising and the sky is clear blue over the Mediterranean: it's going to be a beautiful day.
Being a lighthouse, this pinnacle is way up in the air. Point taken?

There is a storm tossing the deck, one which drives no rain: you reel from one side to the other, hanging onto the rail, grabbing at the mast or the rigging. Nobody else seems to be aboard. The boat makes no headway in a strange, glassy mist.^^The mast rises dizzyingly high.^^You can't even make out the water below. A great pink haze spreads across the sky. With omens like these, who needs albatrosses?
The deck runs fore to aft (as all decks do).

You jump (madly) from the crow's nest 
(tearing the flag as you go) 
to a colourful demise on the deck below.
Up here?
The medicine bottle drops like a stone to the deck far below, where it cracks like an egg.
Dropped a long way down, onto the deck.
You wander out onto the flagpole, which bows and bends alarmingly, until suddenly...^^Crack!  And you are falling
, plummeting, head over heels to the hard wooden deck and the inevitable iron fixtures...
... but gracefully, as the flag billows out into a parachute, until it suddenly tears out of your hand and you come down in an ignominious heap.
You are obliged to leave hold of the flag en route.^^
Coming up here must be one of your less inspired ideas. The mist is all around you, confusing your senses. Two pale, bluish moons hang in a pink sky.
Down might be a better idea.
Up the Mast
The flagpole is very securely fixed to the main mast.
A flagpole juts out portwards from the top of the mast, far too insubstantial to bear any weight. From it hangs the ensign of the British Merchant Navy (which you could just reach the bottom of).
The flagpole juts out to port with the prevailing... wind?

You leave hold of the tassels of the flag.
The flag has fluttered to a heap on deck.
Broad, heavy, scarlet cloth, halfway between a silken sheet and a carpet, with a cross and a Union Jack in one corner.
Piece of advice - it's never very comfortable wrapping yourself in the Flag.

You stand in the triangular prow of the ship, which is graced by a carved and painted figurine and named the ~Lady Magdalena~. There is no sign of water, but the boat is rocked too often for it to be aground. And the glassy mist hangs ahead.
You can only go aft.^
Prow of the Lady Magdalena
Jemima, who has hay fever, is extremely annoyed by this. So it wasn't a turn entirely wasted.
The pollen given off makes you sneeze a little, but fails to give you the bird. (Worth a try, anyway.)
The bird is so startled by the cloud of pollen from the waved branch that she leaps into the skies, squawking with flighty anxiety.
In the Lady Magdalena's loose grip is a traditional sailor's good-luck token: a green-leafed branch, to attract the gulls of an approaching shore.
Oh, you startled me for a moment there! I am getting flighty.

You shin precariously down the anchor chain, but reach the end while still hanging very far above the... water? quicksand?  Concentrating very carefully, you heave yourself back aboard and pant with relief.
You shin down the anchor chain, down, down, under the keel of the Lady Magdalena, down until there is nothing but the glassy mist and the endless chain...^^...And the approaching soft, spongy, pinkish sand-bank, which welcomes you with its warmth: you step ashore, and immediately sink into the clammy, living sand, until you are engulfed altogether... and pass out.^^However, the hard attic floorboards beneath your back soon wake you again.
The square stern of the ship looks out south, not onto receding waves, but to what seems a tunnel through dense, glassy mist. You can faintly make out an odd, pale reddish sand bank in the distance.
The boat runs fore.

The top of the anchor chain is wound around the capstan, a great wheel on the deck beside you. The chain disappears over the side.

With your heart in your mouth, you scale the old fire escape once again, breathing a sigh of relief as you haul yourself in through the open hatchway at the top.^
The old carved southern wall of the gardens blocks your way around the edge of the Hall.
The Hall is in the way.
The fire escape is perilous and leads nowhere. Doubtless it would be useless in any real fire.
At the foot of the Hall is the drive, a long gravel lane approaching the house through trees.^^Since your family are intermittently loading suitcases into the car, which only makes you feel guilty, the only safe way to creep away is along the public footpath, to northeast.
Better not - they might catch you.
Beside the Drive
Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the side of the Hall.
Wistaria climbs a desperately rickety fire escape up the east side of the Hall, and so might you: at the top the fire escape door into the attic is open.
For the first couple of storeys, an old iron zig-zag, and after that a ladder that might or might not be well-anchored. The gardeners have done a good job of concealing it behind wistaria which (in any case) looks the stronger of the two.

By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements. The air is ablaze with pollen and dragonflies.^^It might be possible to scramble down to a hollow, but it surely wouldn't be pleasant.
The footpath turns from southwest to north.
Public Footpath
A low, muddy, stinking hollow, trodden with reeds, dried out in the long summer and no more than moist now. You could climb back up, or go northwest, though that would mean crawling through a thorny hedge.
Hollow
There's a bird's nest at the bottom of the hollow.

The corn crake won't let you near her nest.

Nuts to you too.
Do you know, I love nuts, but I have to be so careful what I eat now... Still, the little ones will have them.

The bird seems not to have heard.
And sat upon it is, as you might expect, a bird: a corn crake, in fact.
A rail with a distinctive cry. And a possessive look.

Beside the long triangle of the green, under the stone cross of the First World War memorial. The public footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the parish church, the ~Goat and Compasses~ pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.
You wander around the peaceful green for a while, but there's nothing to do.

The front page story (~Lord Lucan's new acquisition Shergar comes out of retirement to win the Grand National~) is so boringly unsensational that you quickly lose interest.

The pub is closed, licensing laws being what they are.
In the days of Oliver Cromwell, it was called ~God Encompasseth~, but the locals have worn down the name over the centuries to ~Goat and Compasses~. It is of course closed, owing to the licensing laws. You congratulate yourself on living in such a modern, forward-looking country.

You stroke the monkey's pelt. It jumps about, cheeping.
Evans rather resents this importunate advance.
The monkey sits on Evans' shoulder, cheeping with excitement. Evans has found a pet, and is so gruffly delighted that he has forgotten all about the mascot you stole. Now if he could only predict the 3.40 at Borchester Mills...

The church door is open.
You unbar the door, and let yourself out.^
To your horror your body partly thins to mist as you climb down through the threshold!  Alarmed, you pull back. The underworld beneath the Moonstone, it seems, is not for mortals.
The Moonstone is huge and solid.
Before this was the Norman church of St Michael and All Angels, it was a Saxon one: this is an ancient site. A great space of stone, filled with dark wooden pews and woven mattings. Flowers left over from Sunday grace the lectern and altar. A narrow stair leads upward, and the village green lies to the south.^^Old side chapels lie east and west.
Parish Church
Legend has it nothing holds down the stone, but if so it's far too heavy to budge.
The knight comes a little closer, cupping one ear to pantomime listening. He does seem to have partial hearing.
Set into the floor, and slightly raised, is the Moonstone, an ancient broad flagstone the size of a door, inscribed with a crescent moon.
A passage slants down through a solid crystal doorway in the Moonstone.
The Moonstone is very old, probably pre-dating the rest of the church by some centuries. Legends about it abound: some say the spirits of the departed pass beneath. Old iron rings are set in it, but nobody has ever succeeded in lifting the colossal weight.

He is adamant.
The knight dances a jig with sheer exuberance.
The knight understands what is to be done. But he is world-weary and sad, and not yet in your service.

The knight is confused. Perhaps you were a little rough with the skull.
The knight just about understands that he is to go somewhere, but cannot quite comprehend the direction. You'll have to indicate it somehow. (Shame there were no adamantine ears, really.)

The knight strides down into the underworld beneath the Moonstone, to be lost to your sight... forever?^^For even he has not life force enough to hold together in the mists: his skeleton begins to clatter away to nothing, falling in all directions, his heart, hand and skull returning Somehow to your feet. And they are altering, altering even as you look down into the void...
Somewhat comically, the knight is too bulky to squeeze into the staircase. After a moment or two of watching an immovable object fighting it out with an irresistable force, you point back, and the knight returns, chastened.

^The guardsmen grab your head by the chin and examine you, but take you for a plain thief and immediately put you to the sword. A pity they did not realise your importance, but then they are only guards, and besides they would probably only have done you in more unpleasantly.
^Suddenly you are thrust before a druidical figure. He seems to recognise you, and is troubled. Perhaps because of this, your life is saved and you are taken away into custody, down in the valley among the army encampments.^
This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh.

^A voice, which can just be heard through the vent, says 
something in Anglo-Saxon or Celtic (hard to say which).
~Welcome, great masters. We are convened in secret conclave to decide the fate of Britain. Lament, for the old ways are passing!  There will be a dark age, a collapse into many monarchies, and any man who can hold a town will call himself King and heir to Vortigern.~
^A younger, more impatient voice, says 
something else.
~This is an opportunity!  We must be the power behind the thrones, we will in secret unite and be the true force of the land...~
^There is cynical laughter for a moment, and a third voice interjects 
something.
~And who will lead this, this unity?  We take all sides and none, you know that. There are potent druids in the tents of each general down there in the rabble. They'd kill each other in a second come the battle.~
^The first voice speaks once more. 
~Far worse is to come. The jumped-up kings and their new men will no longer believe in the ancient powers. Already I can feel the druidic magic weakening away, and we are perilously close to the nexus now. In the valleys below, armies wait to fight the decisive battle. Whichever side wins, they will no longer need us. In a matter of hours, the power will be broken forever.~
^After a sombre silence, a much older voice says 
something wise. It really is a pity you can't understand them.
~You did right to call us together. There is a path prepared for us, but the sacrifice will be terrible. We must concentrate all the remaining druidical energy into this sacred hill, that it may last through all time, and we must ensure that druids live on this site forever and keep the faith.~
^The younger voice speaks again. 
~For now, yes, for a century or two, yes, but what then?  They will forget the old ways, they will no longer truly be druids.~
^The older voice replies triumphantly. 
~This is what must be done. They will forget, so we must give them a substitute. We shall accurse them to always seek after this magical stone, which it will be all but impossible for them to find. It will take the form of whatever they most desire. In six hundred years, by my prophecy, religious wars in the East will capture men's hearts, and then they will think it is the Holy Grail, the cup which held the blood of Christ. A thousand years later they will think it is -~ But at this moment the voices move away.

It is a summary of the writings of a polemical monk called Gildas, and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then chiefly to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur.

The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.^^It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation.
The hillside is too steep.
Valley Prospect
You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door.

You climb the ladder and are about to jump onto the roof when you catch sight of a man swaddled in animal furs, spreadeagled over the tiles, looking down into the central courtyard of the villa. He has a nasty-looking sword and since he hasn't seen you, you quietly shin back down the ladder again.
A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here, to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at the lowest point of the tiled roof.

The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north.
Atrium Cloister
You blow the horn, and it lets a great clarion call out to the hills. 
The guardsmen, all over the villa, find you very quickly.^
A call which is rapidly answered as...^
Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-like pole.

The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight.
Atrium
The four quarters show white-beards in the Forum, farmers in Italian fields, a military fortification and a grain ship unloading at Ossia.

Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent.

The well is covered.
Aware of the dangers, you very carefully lower yourself...^
Having no reason to suppose the well is very deep, you cheerfully lower yourself in. This turns out to be something of a misjudgement and you soon lose your grip and fall, endlessly banging against the walls until finally...
What was once the villa's triclinium, or kitchen, is now deserted and long since ransacked for metal. (Nobody lives on their own in this century, and this villa wouldn't be easy to defend.) A doorway to the east gives onto the atrium.

It plummets out of sight, until even the light vanishes in the distance. This must be an extremely deep well.
 drops into the well-shaft.
In one corner is a hinged wooden cover of some kind, which is shut.
The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in diameter. It is very dark inside.
The well has a hinged wooden cover. You can't tell by looking how deep it is.
^You hear a splash from far down in the depths of the well.
kitchen well
In this confined space there is little room for action.
You are clinging perilously to the walls of the deep and dangerous well. You can hardly see a thing, even with the aid of the torch, but curiously enough you feel warm air blowing across you from the east.
Too risky. There might not be anything that way, for all you know.
Inside Well
This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.^^A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came.
The log fires are hot, and anyway the only way out large enough for you is back west.
Hypocaust
Four men in druidic furs are standing on the corners of the mosaic, in some kind of sinister conference. This old villa must be some kind of rendezvous point. Between the men a bluish stone rests on the mosaic floor.
You see across the mosaic floor of the moonlit atrium.
the
vents
You walk out into the courtyard and are immediately set upon by guards, who drag you away.^
A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew Hall will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded.
Entrance
Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent.
This tent doesn't seem to have an exit, either.
Rough Tent
It won't break.
Its base is in the earth.
As you uproot the tent-pole, the whole tent collapses ignominiously, the animal hides falling about your head. The hides are heavy and weigh you down, but you just manage to crawl out...^
^Without warning a Saxon spy (or, as the guards would no doubt put it, another Saxon spy) is thrown bodily into the tent, careering into the central pole and slumping unconscious on the ground as a result. For a moment the whole tent rocks with the force - the pole was nearly broken.^
tent pole
Not only are the guards better at searching suspects than you, they also did so first.
The spy is too deeply unconscious.
Not an act worthy of a Meldrew.
He's asleep.
An unconscious Saxon spy is slumped on the ground. Occasionally faint noises can be heard from him.
He is dishevelled, wiry and unconscious. He is also covered with dust and leaves, as if he has been lying down on his front outdoors for hours.
^Men arrive to drag the Saxon spy away to some unguessable grisly fate. They grimace at you as if to say, ~You're next.~^
^The men arrive once more and this time they securely grab you by the arms. If you were an anthropologist, you'd be fascinated by the ritual in which you are bound up, then garotted with a cord and laid into a peat swamp. Instead, your last thought is of the celebrated body they found when they drained the marshes in 1974 to build a motorway service station.
unconscious Saxon spy
You cross the hot coals nimbly in your sandals.^
Walk across those hot coals!  You must be joking.
Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim.
Far, far too risky.
^It had to happen sooner or later. One of the druids looks round, sees you and raises an instant alarm. It is absolutely hopeless and you are dragged away screaming to your fate.
Encampment
An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals.
dolmen
You stand beside the eerie dolmen, surrounded by the terrible noises and incantations of a druidic rite.
Far, far too risky.
Beneath Dolmen
Resting on top of the dolmen is a polished blue stone.
I wouldn't wave that around if I were you!

A dismal crypt, disused, rainswept and strewn with leaves. Light streams in from the square hole in the roof. There are no bones or urns on show.

The south wall forms a giant bronze mural, which has stood the test of time.
The mural stands slightly to one side, revealing a passage leading downward.
The mural depicts an old bearded wise man following a star in the western sky. He has his right arm around an attractive young woman and holds a bundle of wands with his left hand. Around the border are astrological symbols of all kinds, from Tarot suits to zodiacal constellations.

Ugh.
Something like... perhaps, air after a thunderstorm... but no, you still can't be sure what it is.
Ozone!  That's what it's called. Funny sort of odour for a cave - especially since, on investigating further, you find that it's drifting up from a concealed aluminium staircase.
Definitely ozone.
An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the east.
Jagged Passage
You appear to be standing on a wrought iron key.
A figure-eight double ring, a long barrel and a finely-cut ten-groove claw: this is the ultimate in keys. It is superb.

A long, winding, vile passage through the earth, running east to west. The distasteful odour grows stronger as you go east.
Charnel Passage
Well, perhaps ~sarcophagus~ is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place.
Sarcophagus
Nightmarishly, even the floor you kneel on is a fallen tombstone.
The gist of the inscription is: ~Henri Maladreue, obiit mcdlvi.~

A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west.
You bumped into something unpleasant there.

The odd smell seems to be ozone, and it drifts up from a previously concealed aluminium staircase.

You bump into an invisible barrier - perhaps the edge of the reflection.
The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.^^The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.

Mmm. On the whole, it's probably best not to alter one of the fundamental constants of the physical universe while still inside it. On the bright side, for once you are unlikely to get the blame.
Particularly prominent are a large dial, like the volume control on an expensive hi-fi amplifier, and a big electrician's switch. Both are labelled in small print.

The sphere rings with a hollow noise, but the rod charges up.

A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast) is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.
^A lively, very noisy procession pushes through here, and some spectacular floats are approaching fast.
^The Morning Star leads an enormous procession for the festival of Dionysus, which throngs with officials dressed as satyrs, actors and townswomen.
^Behind the front are huge statues on mechanical floats, flanked by giant overflowing pitchers of wine. And the animals are coming!
^Yes, 2000 oxen dressed in gold, as many dogs, and the giraffes, the antelopes, the gnus, parrots, elephants, wildebeest... ostriches pulling carts, a white bear...
^Next the dancers, in a great masque of the life of Alexander the Great, his travels, conquests, founding of the City, and so on. The delicate matter of how exactly his general Ptolemy took over is omitted, since Ptolemy's son Ptolemy II is now very much in charge.
^The centrepiece of the procession: an enormous gold ribboned phallus, two hundred feet long and with a giant star on the end. Inexplicably, you are the only person present who feels this to be in doubtful taste.
^A procession of women follows next, each in the national dress of an allied city state, from all over the Hellenistic world, North Africa to Sicily to Asia.
^The procession ends as it began, with a great Evening Star, before falling into a shambolic crowd of revellers, drunken and maudlin.
^The procession looks like running on forever.
Causeway
The Pharos is unclimbable, alas.
The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120 metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.^^A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.
The causeway is the only land route off the island.
^Down below, a wave splashes against the sea front, briefly washing up under the grating.
That iron key seems to have washed up here...
...and there's the strange stone again.
^A wave splashes up under the grating, throwing up the strange stone, which bounces back off the grating and washes away down the passage out of sight.^^Well, you didn't think it was going to be that easy, did you?^

The procession happily accommodates another crazily-dressed loon.^
The enormous procession, which throngs the great streets of Alexandria, is impossible to push your way through. Better just enjoy the spectacle.
The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys-shaped Alexandria, greatest city of the civilised world. The northwest-southeast road runs from the causeway to the Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis gate, northeast to the great public buildings of the city.
Crossroads
A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it is ancient. Most of the little termite-hill style pyramids have been invaded time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south.
This is no place to wander after dark.

The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads east. In the centre of the room is a table, which is bare.

Madame Sosostris looks up, startled. ~Yes,~ she says, ~yes... this has potential.~^^She mutters incantations over the green wood and it begins to straighten out in a quite Freudian way. ~It will be ready in two thousand years. Come back then.~^^And she slips something into your palm as she bustles you out.^

It rumbles in your hands, but nothing else happens.
You seem to have dislodged one of the wooden beams used by the tomb's builders: a useful length of greenish oak.
It needs to be left to mature, and yet there's something awfully familiar about it.
Ready to use.
Perhaps it could be put aside for later use.

A silver locket on a thin chain, with a heart-shaped picture of a knight placing a rose in his lady's hair. Quite nauseously romantic.

Down by the sea-front, in the old harbourlands, surrounded by warehouses. The Mediterranean laps darkly against the hard, splashing an occasional wave up the slope. The city, and the party, lie back east.
There's nowhere to go but the city, east.

The celebrated Library of Alexandria, finest in the entire world, possessed of hundreds of thousands of books: where the ruling Ptolemies keep fanatic, infighting scholars almost imprisoned as they turn out rival commentaries on the ancient poems - hence the nickname.^^There is a little door to the south; a dusty corridor southeast; a thoroughfare east, and a grand entrance northwest.
^A messenger-boy in a plain white tunic slips into the library and places a couple of tubes in the pigeonhole. So resentful is he of missing the party outside that he fails to notice you, and runs back out again at once.^
The Birdcage of the Muses
There is a pigeonhole mounted on one wall.
A depository for scrolls.

An open-ended hollow tube, marked with a Greek capital Alpha.
Surely this is addressed to someone?

All Greek to you, alas, and running on for 1000 lines or more.
Oh my. Well, the plot, um, there are seven attackers, all with different shields, one for each of the seven city gates, and it's a civil war so of course the brothers are really in a duel and there are champions and the women are upset but it's all because of their brother who was really their father... Never mind. It's strictly for aficionados.

That hardly seems worthwhile.
You smear some oil on your head, making a mental note to wash your hair in the morning. It is the least sacred sacred ritual you have ever taken part in.
This small, dark (by night) room is a repository for Library supplies: above all, for lamp oil, which is stored in broad shallow earthenware troughs. Lucky your torch is electric, when you think about it. Anyway, a passage leads back north.

What a revolting idea!

The rather neglected hall for the accurate study of geography: as opposed to the lurid travellers' tales preferred by most writers in this slapdash century. Nobody is working here, and one can only file back northwest.
In order to make sure the geographers don't get lost, the only exit is northwest.

Once the polar axis of a globe.
As you pull out its polar axis, the spindle, the Earth collapses altogether in a possibly symbolic, certainly dusty shambles.
Protruding from a broken globe of the Earth (marked with very tentative and approximate maps) is the spindle, the only thing holding it together.
Perhaps the best work of cartography likely for the next two thousand years, though it seems unlikely to last the next two hours.
Don't go waving this about.
spindle from the globe
A spacious, densely colonnaded corridor, its walls lined with inset shelves on which are scrolls beyond count, ribboned, dusty, disintegrating, badly catalogued so that only an expert can find what he wants.
You wander through the columns, but can find no exit save the thoroughfare west and a little office south.
Reading Corridor
Even a single book may run for dozens of individual scrolls, and the titles are hard to interpret: anyway, most of the books are rubbish. Dewey decimal numbers are not due to be invented for millenia.

Apollonius and Callimachus are now engaged in a furious, ugly brawl, from which it seems unlikely they will emerge for some considerable time.
One look is enough. He throws a vicious punch, and the librarians begin a savage bare-knuckled fist fight.^^This, shall we say, rather petty practical joke of yours does seem to have had one interesting consequence, though.
~Arrghhhieee!~ he says (untranslatably), boiling over with rage. He then curses repeatedly, but the only word you can make out is ~

Callimachus
Apollonius and Callimachus are having a furious, heated, endless argument about something. They seem well practised at this occupation.

Eventually, after a very long wait,

, which, to say the least, comes as a surprise. Such a fuss is kicked up that you are quickly thrown out into the street.^
How could you bribe such disinterested men of learning as the librarians?
As a barbarian scholar, unversed in Greek, you can hardly expect to converse with such as he.
The expert in question being Callimachus, who is brooding over a scroll, and hardly aware of your presence.
Callimachus is famous for something or other. You wonder what...
Callimachus
Apollonius seems to have dropped a mystic scroll in the scuffle.
It tells that even the greatest mortal must choose of the three High [and the next word is illegible], for once and all, but that for each there is a way. The usual mystic nonsense.
Don't you believe it!
We in the afterlife, um, have a policy of never commenting on leaked documents.

And Callimachus' purple shoulder-sash has come off.
Worn over the shoulder.

A tiny office adjoining the colonnades north, this is home to Apollonius the head Librarian, whose writing implements, table and sand-wells are scattered untidily about.
Librarian's Office
Apollonius paces about self-importantly in a purple sash, perusing documents on his desk.
His aim in life is chiefly to annoy Callimachus, his junior librarian and the modern poet he despises most.

Or you could just saunter up to them wearing a cloak of many colours. Have it your own way.
^You tiptoe into the palace, and immediately dart away from view of the many clerks and civil servants manning the machinery of government even at this late hour. Within seconds, you realise you are...^
A hugely impressive edifice, and everything you might expect from the man who conquered the whole of Asia Minor at an age when most people are starting to think about getting a mortgage.^^There are of course guards, but they're trying to catch the procession, so if you're careful not to draw attention to yourself you could probably sneak in to the north.
Outside the Royal Palace of Alexander
The slave looks you over and sees that you do not bear the mark of an accredited visitor to the Palace.  You are discreetly escorted out.
The slave politely holds your arm fast until you desist.
Scholars are divided on the origin of the ~maze~ legend: some hold that to a primitive culture, the Knossos palace was so complex as to seem a maze, and the king so fearsome as to seem a Minotaur.^^Others say the early palaces really were labyrinths to protect sacred altars.^^And you think it's because this is a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
Lost inside the Palace
A slave stands impassively by one wall.
Such a slave, a highly trained professional, stands at every intersection of passages in the palace. They are deaf mutes, to prevent them overhearing State secrets.

The slave here, a senior adviser merely disguised as a deaf mute, reacts at once, taking you by the arm and leading you on a convoluted path through the Palace to the...^
You dive off the balcony in a beautifully graceful motion, plunging perfectly into the icy and (fortunately) deep waters below. You then struggle to the surface in a panicky, floundering motion, and finally wash up out of the water in a clumsy, ridiculous one.
The magnificent balcony overlooking the Royal harbour of Alexandria. In two hundred years' time, Julius Caesar will be besieged here, and will hold the palace with a tiny force of men against an entire army: and will lose his heart to Cleopatra...^^For the mean time, this is a broad stone balustraded balcony. The coin-bright moon, low in the sky, reflects off the black waters far below.
There seems to be absolutely no way off the balcony, as the stone doors to the heart of the palace are sealed shut.

Instead, there is an astrolabe.
It fits beautifully, as if designed to go there.

The angel acknowledges the question, but cannot bring herself to speak of Hell.
~The rods definitely fit into all this somewhere.~
~If only you could have been there when the maze was being laid out!~
~The master game is like a point at infinity to we mortals,~ the angel says wistfully.
~All a matter of fitting the rods in somewhere.~
~How she must long to let her hair down now, instead of being chained to that rock,~ the angel says sorrowfully. ~But in deference to her wishes, I cannot help you rescue her.~
~Amazing fortune you must have in finding it, I can tell.~
~Ah yes, we must all lament for human folly,~ says the angel, misunderstanding completely.
~Zeus wasn't a true god, of course,~ the angel predictably insists, ~just a manifestation of the laws of physics to an Ancient Greek, a kind of symbol for the way the universe fundamentally worked.~
The angel maintains a tight-lipped silence.
~That's too dangerous a rod to actually use, of course, and the Church no longer approves of martyrs.~
~Is there really such a thing as luck, or free will?  It's a theological grey area,~ says the angel with fine casuistry.
~Certainly a thorny problem, that.~
~Old Evans would never give you his mascot of his own free will.~

~Some of those ancient knights were rather loose, but perhaps that's better than being screwed up.~
~The Great Library isn't for passing hooligans, you know,~ says the angel reprovingly. ~Besides, the guards understand their duty by the Cat God far too well to let you through.~
~They're always at each other's throats. I shudder to think what might happen if a real fight broke out.~
~Oh, find yourself a costume, join the party!~
~The green wood may one day make a really good staff, but it could take ages. Better leave it with someone for safe keeping.~
~Some choices are inevitable and permanent, at least in this world.~
~Do be careful of the trap, won't you!  You might want to take precautions with the opening.~
~Let me see.~
~You appreciate, in my position I can't really comment on graven images of pagan gods. Better try some dictionary or other.~
~That woman will rabbit on, once you set her off. But only if you sacrifice something. Will you be joining us next Harvest Sunday, by the way?~
~Ooh, it does make me shiver, thinking of the way they used to pour oil over themselves, anointing they called it.~
~Shabby old gossip, Homer, always reminds me of Peter Falk. Anyway, just give him his answers. Shouldn't be too hard, with what you're wearing and carrying.~
~Going in round the front just scares the birds away, I fear.~
~Find out what you can about your ancestor who built it - his tomb isn't far away. Then reflect as best you can on the problem.~
~Well, if you know what the odour is, that's the main thing.~

~All right, toad, you have one, just one, chance left,~ says the demon with a memorable smile.
~Now then, two chances remaining,~ says the demon with a memorable smile.
~Good afternoon,~ says the demon with a memorable smile. ~As a reward for your naked greed, may I welcome you to our little information service. We try to be as helpful as possible to explorers who are lost, or can't think how to solve their problems, you know the kind of thing. So just tell me what you want to know, or show me something to look at. You get the usual three hints.~
Hell, you always imagined, would contain fiery, sulphurous pits and a great many gentlemen with forked tails. You were right about the last part. A demon is sitting behind a flame-proofed desk at the bottom of the stairs. There are some disconcerting screams from further away, but nothing to worry about. Not in this life, anyway.
That direction is not for the living.
^There is a horrid grinding noise from far away.
^A flash of light sears your eyes, as the sulphurous flames grumble.
^You can almost, but not quite, make out the noise of shouting.
^Thunder and lightning can be heard from the fiery depths.

The clouds are too fluffy.
~Take all the time you need,~ says the angel kindly.
~I'm afraid I can be of no further use to you!  See you in another life,~ says the angel with a memorable smile.
~You have one remaining question,~ says the angel with a memorable smile.
~A whole two questions left,~ says the angel with a memorable smile.
~Good day,~ says the angel with a memorable smile. ~As a reward for your act of faith, may I welcome you to our little information service. We try to be as helpful as possible to explorers who are lost, or can't think how to solve their problems. Is there anything, pray, which you would like a hint about, or which you'd like to show me?  You are permitted three hints in all, in accordance with standard practice.~
Heaven, you always imagined, would be a world of marble pillars, fluffy clouds, harps and angelic ladies with serene expressions. You were right about the last part. An angel is sitting here behind some new office furniture, next to a blue Tourist Information sign. A bridge of cloud extends south across the sky to the beanstalk. There is some choral singing going on somewhere, but not loud enough for you to hear properly. Not in this life, anyway.
That direction is not for the living.
^Angels with harps float by, gossiping about you in a kindly way.
^Babies float by, just counting their toes.
^Burnished-gold sunlight strokes the tops of the clouds here.
^The choir invisible almost, for a moment, becomes audible.

^^^^It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these lofts...^
^A shame to see such a good try unrewarded... oh, go on, have an extra five points.
^Under the circumstances, the 5-point bonus is forfeit.
As you step falteringly through the darkness, the air falls ice-cold, whispering in secret languages. Suddenly a great bear rears up before you, savagely sweeping its paw!
As you unwisely blunder about in the dark, you 
slip down a side passage of the chimney, further and further, blindly landing in a cloud of soot in the fireplace of the lounge downstairs. Fortunately your family is on hand to clean you up and put you back to work packing.
miss your footing, trip over and bang your head... Some time later you wake up in hospital, very confused and not on holiday. Fortunately Aunt Jemima comes to visit you every afternoon with plenty of things for you to do...

I don't know who was there before me:
One person, several, none;

Some certainly not made by human hands.

It has always seemed to me that I had to answer

You're going nowhere until you make amends for that nasty bad language.
With the gas mask on all you can smell is old cork and rubber.
Not with a gas mask on!
Your speech is muffled into silence by the gas mask.
Not really a suitable implement.
You have nothing really suitable to hand.
You succeed only in turning the earth further.
Archaeology is not for the amateur!
The gravel is thin and lies on concrete.
Surreal!
The ground is unsuitable.
You surely don't want to dig here, right in the middle of such a fine lawn. The peg would fall out, and that would never do.
There is already a hole on this exact spot of the lawn.
You dig an energetic little hole in the superb turf
, filling your last one up with the earth uncovered
, until your spade bumps into something solid
, failing to find whatever it was you buried
.
You lie down on the floor for a while and then get up again, feeling foolish.
You'll have to say exactly how to do that.
That won't achieve anything very much.
That isn't in conspicuous need of support.
That isn't a particularly good support.
The timber prop leans against the tottering Folly, supporting it.
You lean the timber prop against the Folly tower, supporting it. (Better just hope you won't be needing the prop for anything else!)
Hang on a moment... yes, you're still breathing. Keep it up!
You pace up and down, Holmes-fashion.
Perhaps you should say which way to pace.
What?
Hardly!
That would go past the edge of the lawn.
The ball is not on the ground.
You strike the ball with the mallet, and a pleasing cracking sound.^
^The ball ricochets around the ornaments as on a pinball table.
^The ball runs smoothly across the lawn
 and falls in the hole.
There are paths only west and northwest.
, along to the northwestern hedge and into an irate squirrel. In a sudden rustle he leaps away, knocking aside a rotten branch and uncovering a tiny gap through the hedge.
You would achieve nothing by this.
Are you feeling quite right?
You'll have to be a little more explicit.
discovering rods^
bonus for a good try^
destroying universe^
^Sadly, you missed out on the 50-point bonus for rescuing Andromeda.
But you aren't holding it.
Light pulses around the daisy chain, then leaps out to engulf 
 which melts into 
!
Light pulses from the daisy behind your ear, leaping out to engulf 
 which melts into 
!
That seems to be not quite how they work...
You can't wave what you're wearing.
You look ridiculous waving 
.
You make a wish.
The wishbone has already been pulled, and you have the part which lost.
 does not wish to dance with you.
Graffiti is uncouth.
The silver plaque is extremely strong, and resists all attempts to mark it.
 is unsuitable for turning things.
(The wrench seems unnecessary, so you use bare hands.)^
(If you insist.)  
There is no reply.
That's not something you can wash with.
You've no soap.
Ugh, it tastes absolutely ghastly. But you feel better for it.
Now, that sort of language is an absolute disgrace, and you're going to have to pay the price for it.
It's good that you can express your frustration in such a mild way.
Oh, don't apologise.
Sorry isn't good enough!
You point at 
.
Please point it at something.
A useless gesture.
But you aren't holding it.
It's too fiddly pointing it at something you're holding.
Ok. (Why?)
Nothing happens.
** No rod routine **
But you aren't holding it.
You ineffectually bash 
 on the ground.
The already-charged rod explodes with cataclysmic violence, burying everything nearby in rubble!
The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley lines...
Pour encourager les udders... But milking goats is no job for an amateur.
What?
That sort of wilful damage to property is exactly what's wrong with the world today. And another thing, the influence of so-called rock and roll music on society has in my view, and I may be old-fashioned, but... [etc]
For a moment you can almost hear a hoarse voice say something to you. But it passes.
You feel inexplicably powerful, but nothing happens. Perhaps you should have addressed yourself more precisely.
For a moment you can almost hear thunder, as though it were saying something. But the moment passes.
Inside the golden orb.
This is the afternoon of June 3rd, 1993, and you are in Meldrew Hall.
It is early morning on October 5th, 1922, and you are in the Unreal City.
It is nearly midnight on October 31st, 1988, and you are in a museum in Hamburg.
You are passing among the strange, unearthly world of the Tarot box.
It is the afternoon of June 3rd, 1993, and you are in the gardens.
It is about noon on March 14th, 1808, and you are in the gardens.
It is some time in the sixth century A.D., and you are in the Master Game.
Time seems to have no meaning, and you are dreaming.
It is the afternoon of June 3rd, 1993, and you are in the catacombs beneath the gardens.
It is some time in the winter of 275 B.C., the reign of Ptolemy II, and you are in ancient Alexandria.
It is the afternoon of June 3rd, 1993, and you are northeast of Meldrew Hall.
You are in the Spirit World, centuries ahead of your sleeping body.
In the great Monopoly-board Jail of the afterlife, you are ~Just Visiting~.
The angel looks at you reproachfully.
The demon looks at you viciously.
Failed.
Ok.^
For heaven's sake, this is your own house.
No, this is a goat. A ~ram~ is a kind of sheep.
Please don't ram anything. This computer only has limited RAM.
How, exactly?
You don't seem to have a suitable focus.
Unaided, you are unable to make any impression.
You set the gold watch swinging, back and forth, spinning the light. 
Old Evans, who is nine-tenths hypnotised most of the time anyway, succumbs easily.
But 
 seems wilful enough to resist hypnosis.
You have no oil.
Nothing happens.
~Slide~ is inappropriate here.
What piece was that?
Unfortunately, '
' is not adjacent to the gap.
You slide '
' into the gap, leaving the grid looking like:^^
^There is a click from the mechanism. Pulleys pull. Cogs spin. Little bits of string run.^
^The cannonball drops out of the metal hand, and falls into the higher basket, which plunges down, hurling the other basket upwards, 
but it must have been empty.
and projecting 
something
some things
 up the hole in the corner.^
^A moment later, however, there is a distant but loud thump. A moment after that, something plummets back down out of the hole (in a shower of thin white plaster) and into the higher basket, which (owing to fantastic machinery) wrenches down again, hurling the cannonball in the other end up into the air.^^The metal hand catches the cannonball beautifully.^
You are not in any suitable means of transport.
The skiff gathers wind from somewhere, which whistles past you until your eyes are blurred and watery. When you look around, you find that you are moored once again...^
That seems to be happening whether you like it or not.
You set sail, and a light breeze propels your skiff...^
Austin is quite unruffled.
For some reason, Austin is startled and springs for his life 
right up through the south wall and into Alexandria!
There are hints built into this game, but you will have to find out for yourself how to get them.
