 *   How to Play Interactive Fiction   *
(An entire strategy guide on a single postcard)
Written by Andrew Plotkin -- design by Lea Albaugh
A PR-IF service <http://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/>

This is a handy IF-for-beginners card that we came up with for the
People's Republic of Interactive Fiction Hospitality Suite at 
PAX-East 2010. If somebody is sitting down in front of an IF game for
the very first time, this card should give him or her an idea of what
commands will work -- and what commands are *likely* to work. It's not
trying to teach everything an IF expert would know; it's just
conveying the pattern.

The package contains the file in several formats: PDF, JPEG, PNG, SVG.
There's also a PNG file at 300dpi, suitable for printing at 5" by 7".
The HTML file is not identical, but renders a good approximation for
web browsers.

If you want to do primary editing, your best shot is to use Adobe
Illustrator and load the PDF file. (It uses the "Arno Pro" font, in
several weights.) The SVG file was also generated by Illustrator, and
is unfortunately difficult to edit in Inkscape; fonts are named
slightly inconsistently, and the letter spacing comes out wrong.
